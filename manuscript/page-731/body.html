Then it had been lovely with narcissus and violets; now golden rod had kindled its fairy torches in the corners and asters dotted it bluely. The call of the brook came up through the woods from the valley of birches with all its old allurement; the mellow air was full of the purr of the sea; beyond were fields rimmed by fences bleached silvery gray in the suns of many summers, and long hills scarfed with the shadows of autumnal clouds; with the blowing of the west wind old dreams returned.</p><p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Anne softly, &ldquo;that &lsquo;the land where dreams come true&rsquo; is in the blue haze yonder, over that little valley.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
