I keep at my man to build a new kitchen, but he ain&rsquo;t one of your hustlers. The parlor&rsquo;s in there and there&rsquo;s two rooms upstairs. Just prowl about yourselves. I&rsquo;ve got to see to the baby. The east room was the one you were born in. I remember your ma saying she loved to see the sunrise; and I mind hearing that you was born just as the sun was rising and its light on your face was the first thing your ma saw.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
