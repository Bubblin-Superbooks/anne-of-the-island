<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> They&rsquo;re too exotic&mdash;too tropical&mdash;too insolent. Don&rsquo;t put them in your hair, anyway.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I won&rsquo;t. I admit I&rsquo;m not fond of orchids myself. I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re related to me. Roy doesn&rsquo;t often send them&mdash;he knows I like flowers I can live with. Orchids are only things you can visit with.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jonas sent me some dear pink rosebuds for the evening&mdash;but&mdash;he isn&rsquo;t coming himself. He said he had to lead a prayer-meeting in the slums! I don&rsquo;t believe he wanted to come. Anne, I&rsquo;m horribly afraid Jonas doesn&rsquo;t really care anything about me. And I&rsquo;m trying to decide whether I&rsquo;ll pine away and die, or go on and get my B.A. and be sensible and useful.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
