<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Dear old Jane&mdash;I&rsquo;m so glad,&rdquo; said Anne heartily. &ldquo;She deserves the good things of life.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I ain&rsquo;t saying anything against Jane. She&rsquo;s a nice enough girl. But she isn&rsquo;t in the millionaire class, and you&rsquo;ll find there&rsquo;s not much to recommend that man but his money, that&rsquo;s what. Mrs. Harmon says he&rsquo;s an Englishman who has made money in mines but I believe he&rsquo;ll turn out to be a Yankee. He certainly must have money, for he has just showered Jane with jewelry. Her engagement ring is a diamond cluster so big that it looks like a plaster on Jane&rsquo;s fat paw.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
