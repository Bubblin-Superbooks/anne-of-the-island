You&rsquo;ll be brave, and believe that all is going to be well with you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try. I&rsquo;ll think over what you have said, and try to believe it. And you&rsquo;ll come up as often as you can, won&rsquo;t you, Anne?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, dear.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&mdash;it won&rsquo;t be very long now, Anne. I feel sure of that. And I&rsquo;d rather have you than any one else. I always liked you best of all the girls I went to school with. You were never jealous, or mean, like some of them were. Poor Em White was up to see me yesterday. You remember Em and I were such chums for three years when we went to school? And then we quarrelled the time of the school concert. We&rsquo;ve never spoken to each other since.</p></div> </div>
