<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Goodness, no. I couldn&rsquo;t love anybody. It isn&rsquo;t in me. Besides I wouldn&rsquo;t want to. Being in love makes you a perfect slave, I think. And it would give a man such power to hurt you. I&rsquo;d be afraid. No, no, Alec and Alonzo are two dear boys, and I like them both so much that I really don&rsquo;t know which I like the better. That is the trouble. Alec is the best looking, of course, and I simply couldn&rsquo;t marry a man who wasn&rsquo;t handsome. He is good-tempered too, and has lovely, curly, black hair. He&rsquo;s rather too perfect&mdash;I don&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;d like a perfect husband&mdash;somebody I could never find fault with.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
