<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Aunt Jamesina was a tiny old woman with a little, softly-triangular face, and large, soft blue eyes that were alight with unquenchable youth, and as full of hopes as a girl&rsquo;s. She had pink cheeks and snow-white hair which she wore in quaint little puffs over her ears.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very old-fashioned way,&rdquo; she said, knitting industriously at something as dainty and pink as a sunset cloud. &ldquo;But I am old-fashioned. My clothes are, and it stands to reason my opinions are, too. I don&rsquo;t say they&rsquo;re any the better of that, mind you. In fact, I daresay they&rsquo;re a good deal the worse. But they&rsquo;ve worn nice and easy. New shoes are smarter than old ones, but the old ones are more comfortable. I&rsquo;m old enough to indulge myself in the matter of shoes and opinions. I mean to take it real easy here.</p></div> </div>
