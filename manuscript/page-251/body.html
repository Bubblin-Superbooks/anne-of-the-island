Wouldn&rsquo;t it sour almost any one? She should have tried to imagine her name was Cordelia. It might have helped her a great deal. It certainly helped me in the days when I didn&rsquo;t like ANNE.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Josie Pye will be just like her when she grows up,&rdquo; said Diana. &ldquo;Josie&rsquo;s mother and Aunt Atossa are cousins, you know. Oh, dear, I&rsquo;m glad that&rsquo;s over. She&rsquo;s so malicious&mdash;she seems to put a bad flavor in everything. Father tells such a funny story about her. One time they had a minister in Spencervale who was a very good, spiritual man but very deaf.</p></div> </div>
