They were alone in the living room. Stella and Priscilla had gone to a committee meeting and Phil was upstairs adorning herself for a party.</p><p>&ldquo;I suppose you feel kind of, sorry&rdquo; said Aunt Jamesina. &ldquo;The teens are such a nice part of life. I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;ve never gone out of them myself.&rdquo;</p><p>Anne laughed.</p><p>&ldquo;You never will, Aunty. You&rsquo;ll be eighteen when you should be a hundred. Yes, I&rsquo;m sorry, and a little dissatisfied as well. Miss Stacy told me long ago that by the time I was twenty my character would be formed, for good or evil.</p></div> </div>
