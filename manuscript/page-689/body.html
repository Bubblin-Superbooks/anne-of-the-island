<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Anne felt that life partook of the nature of an anticlimax during the first few weeks after her return to Green Gables. She missed the merry comradeship of Patty&rsquo;s Place. She had dreamed some brilliant dreams during the past winter and now they lay in the dust around her. In her present mood of self-disgust, she could not immediately begin dreaming again. And she discovered that, while solitude with dreams is glorious, solitude without them has few charms.</p><p>She had not seen Roy again after their painful parting in the park pavilion; but Dorothy came to see her before she left Kingsport.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully sorry you won&rsquo;t marry Roy,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I did want you for a sister. But you are quite right. He would bore you to death. I love him, and he is a dear sweet boy, but really he isn&rsquo;t a bit interesting. He looks as if he ought to be, but he isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
