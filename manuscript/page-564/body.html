<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &lsquo;Sarah Crowe,&rsquo; say I&mdash;my first was a Crowe&mdash;&lsquo;you can marry your rich man if you like but you won&rsquo;t be happy. Folks can&rsquo;t get along together in this world without a little bit of love. You&rsquo;d just better tie up to Thomas, for he loves you and you love him and nothing else ain&rsquo;t going to do you.&rsquo; Jog along, black mare. So I told Thomas I&rsquo;d take him. All the time I was getting ready I never dared drive past W.O.&lsquo;s place for fear the sight of that fine house of his would put me in the swithers again. But now I never think of it at all, and I&rsquo;m just that comfortable and happy with Thomas. Jog along, black mare.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
