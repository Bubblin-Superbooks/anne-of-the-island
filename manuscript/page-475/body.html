I&rsquo;ve neglected you shamefully this summer, honey, but all my other correspondents have been neglected, too. I have a huge pile of letters to answer, so I must gird up the loins of my mind and hoe in. Excuse my mixed metaphors. I&rsquo;m fearfully sleepy. Last night Cousin Emily and I were calling at a neighbor&rsquo;s. There were several other callers there, and as soon as those unfortunate creatures left, our hostess and her three daughters picked them all to pieces. I knew they would begin on Cousin Emily and me as soon as the door shut behind us. When we came home Mrs. Lilly informed us that the aforesaid neighbor&rsquo;s hired boy was supposed to be down with scarlet fever.</p></div> </div>
