<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> SHE would always know what hat to put on. Probably she would have only one. Ministers never have much money. But she wouldn&rsquo;t mind having one hat or none at all, because she would have Jonas.</p><p>&ldquo;Anne Shirley, don&rsquo;t you dare to say or hint or think that I&rsquo;ve fallen in love with Mr. Blake. Could I care for a lank, poor, ugly theologue&mdash;named Jonas? As Uncle Mark says, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s impossible, and what&rsquo;s more it&rsquo;s improbable.&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good night, PHIL.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;P.S. It is impossible&mdash;but I am horribly afraid it&rsquo;s true. I&rsquo;m happy and wretched and scared. HE can NEVER care for me, I know. Do you think I could ever develop into a passable minister&rsquo;s wife, Anne? And WOULD they expect me to lead in prayer? P G.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
