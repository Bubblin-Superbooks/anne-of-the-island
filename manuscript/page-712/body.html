<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It was a wet, bleak, cruel evening in July when Anne came back to Green Gables. One of the fierce summer storms which sometimes sweep over the gulf was ravaging the sea. As Anne came in the first raindrops dashed against the panes.</p><p>&ldquo;Was that Paul who brought you home?&rdquo; asked Marilla. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you make him stay all night. It&rsquo;s going to be a wild evening.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll reach Echo Lodge before the rain gets very heavy, I think. Anyway, he wanted to go back tonight. Well, I&rsquo;ve had a splendid visit, but I&rsquo;m glad to see you dear folks again. &lsquo;East, west, hame&rsquo;s best.&rsquo; Davy, have you been growing again lately?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
