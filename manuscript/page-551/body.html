Getting married can&rsquo;t be so very terrible when so many people survive the ceremony. See how cool and composed I am, and take courage.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wait till your turn comes, Miss Anne. Oh, Anne, I hear father coming upstairs. Give me my bouquet. Is my veil right? Am I very pale?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You look just lovely. Di, darling, kiss me good-bye for the last time. Diana Barry will never kiss me again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Diana Wright will, though. There, mother&rsquo;s calling. Come.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
