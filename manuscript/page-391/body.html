<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>When Christmas holidays came the girls of Patty&rsquo;s Place scattered to their respective homes, but Aunt Jamesina elected to stay where she was.</p><p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t go to any of the places I&rsquo;ve been invited and take those three cats,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m not going to leave the poor creatures here alone for nearly three weeks. If we had any decent neighbors who would feed them I might, but there&rsquo;s nothing except millionaires on this street. So I&rsquo;ll stay here and keep Patty&rsquo;s Place warm for you.&rdquo;</p><p>Anne went home with the usual joyous anticipations&mdash;which were not wholly fulfilled.
