<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Wasn&rsquo;t it silly? Anything like that seems silly NOW. But Em and I made up the old quarrel yesterday. She said she&rsquo;d have spoken years ago, only she thought I wouldn&rsquo;t. And I never spoke to her because I was sure she wouldn&rsquo;t speak to me. Isn&rsquo;t it strange how people misunderstand each other, Anne?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Most of the trouble in life comes from misunderstanding, I think,&rdquo; said Anne. &ldquo;I must go now, Ruby. It&rsquo;s getting late&mdash;and you shouldn&rsquo;t be out in the damp.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll come up soon again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, very soon. And if there&rsquo;s anything I can do to help you I&rsquo;ll be so glad.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
