<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> He was real kind and feeling, and did everything he could for me, but he never said marry. And that&rsquo;s the way it has been going on ever since. People blame ME for it. They say I won&rsquo;t marry him because his mother is so sickly and I don&rsquo;t want the bother of waiting on her. Why, I&rsquo;d LOVE to wait on John&rsquo;s mother! But I let them think so. I&rsquo;d rather they&rsquo;d blame me than pity me! It&rsquo;s so dreadful humiliating that John won&rsquo;t ask me. And WHY won&rsquo;t he? Seems to me if I only knew his reason I wouldn&rsquo;t mind it so much.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Perhaps his mother doesn&rsquo;t want him to marry anybody,&rdquo; suggested Anne.</p></div> </div>
