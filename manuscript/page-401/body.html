It&rsquo;s three days since we got it. I want to see what them pesky Grits are doing. I&rsquo;m a Conservative, Anne. And I tell you, you have to keep your eye on them Grits.&rdquo;</p><p>Mr. Harrison had brought the mail, and merry letters from Stella and Priscilla and Phil soon dissipated Anne&rsquo;s blues. Aunt Jamesina, too, had written, saying that she was keeping the hearth-fire alight, and that the cats were all well, and the house plants doing fine.</p><p>&ldquo;The weather has been real cold,&rdquo; she wrote, &ldquo;so I let the cats sleep in the house&mdash;Rusty and Joseph on the sofa in the living-room, and the Sarah-cat on the foot of my bed.</p></div> </div>
