And yet I somehow feel she needs help&mdash;craves it&mdash;and I want to give it to her and can&rsquo;t. All the time I&rsquo;m with her I feel as if I were watching her struggle with an invisible foe&mdash;trying to push it back with such feeble resistance as she has. That is why I come home tired.&rdquo;</p><p>But tonight Anne did not feel this so keenly. Ruby was strangely quiet. She said not a word about parties and drives and dresses and &ldquo;fellows.&rdquo; She lay in the hammock, with her untouched work beside her, and a white shawl wrapped about her thin shoulders.</p></div> </div>
