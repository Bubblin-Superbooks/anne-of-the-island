<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how you managed to make up your mind to come to Redmond at all, if you are really such an undecided person,&rdquo; said amused Priscilla.</p><p>&ldquo;Bless your heart, honey, I didn&rsquo;t. It was father who wanted me to come here. His heart was set on it&mdash;why, I don&rsquo;t know. It seems perfectly ridiculous to think of me studying for a B.A. degree, doesn&rsquo;t it? Not but what I can do it, all right. I have heaps of brains.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Priscilla vaguely.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. But it&rsquo;s such hard work to use them. And B.A.&lsquo;s are such learned, dignified, wise, solemn creatures&mdash;they must be. No, I didn&rsquo;t want to come to Redmond. I did it just to oblige father. He IS such a duck. Besides, I knew if I stayed home I&rsquo;d have to get married.</p></div> </div>
