<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come up to ask you to go for one of our old-time rambles through September woods and &lsquo;over hills where spices grow,&rsquo; this afternoon,&rdquo; said Gilbert, coming suddenly around the porch corner. &ldquo;Suppose we visit Hester Gray&rsquo;s garden.&rdquo;</p><p>Anne, sitting on the stone step with her lap full of a pale, filmy, green stuff, looked up rather blankly.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I wish I could,&rdquo; she said slowly, &ldquo;but I really can&rsquo;t, Gilbert. I&rsquo;m going to Alice Penhallow&rsquo;s wedding this evening, you know. I&rsquo;ve got to do something to this dress, and by the time it&rsquo;s finished I&rsquo;ll have to get ready. I&rsquo;m so sorry. I&rsquo;d love to go.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
