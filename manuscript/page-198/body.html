<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&rsquo; I used to argue the matter at first, but I&rsquo;m wiser now. Facts are stubborn things, but as some one has wisely said, not half so stubborn as fallacies. So I only smile loftily now in eloquent silence. Why, I have nine grades in my school and I have to teach a little of everything, from investigating the interiors of earthworms to the study of the solar system. My youngest pupil is four&mdash;his mother sends him to school to &lsquo;get him out of the way&rsquo;&mdash;and my oldest twenty&mdash;it &lsquo;suddenly struck him&rsquo; that it would be easier to go to school and get an education than follow the plough any longer. In the wild effort to cram all sorts of research into six hours a day I don&rsquo;t wonder if the children feel like the little boy who was taken to see the biograph. &lsquo;I have to look for what&rsquo;s coming next before I know what went last,&rsquo; he complained. I feel like that myself.</p></div> </div>
