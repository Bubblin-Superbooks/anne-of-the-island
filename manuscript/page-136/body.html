<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> That is, Alec would think it funny, but Alonzo wouldn&rsquo;t be likely to. I was in a hurry, so I snatched Alec&rsquo;s letter&mdash;as I thought&mdash;out of the envelope and scribbled down a postscript. Then I mailed both letters. I got Alonzo&rsquo;s reply this morning. Girls, I had put that postscript to his letter and he was furious. Of course he&rsquo;ll get over it&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t care if he doesn&rsquo;t&mdash;but it spoiled my day. So I thought I&rsquo;d come to you darlings to get cheered up. After the football season opens I won&rsquo;t have any spare Saturday afternoons. I adore football. I&rsquo;ve got the most gorgeous cap and sweater striped in Redmond colors to wear to the games. To be sure, a little way off I&rsquo;ll look like a walking barber&rsquo;s pole. Do you know that that Gilbert of yours has been elected Captain of the Freshman football team?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
