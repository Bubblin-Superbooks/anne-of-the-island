It is never pleasant to have our old shrines desecrated, even when we have outgrown them.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be so lonesome when you go,&rdquo; moaned Diana for the hundredth time. &ldquo;And to think you go next week!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;re together still,&rdquo; said Anne cheerily. &ldquo;We mustn&rsquo;t let next week rob us of this week&rsquo;s joy. I hate the thought of going myself&mdash;home and I are such good friends. Talk of being lonesome! It&rsquo;s I who should groan. YOU&rsquo;LL be here with any number of your old friends&mdash;AND Fred! While I shall be alone among strangers, not knowing a soul!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
