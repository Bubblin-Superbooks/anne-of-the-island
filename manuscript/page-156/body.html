How do you like my picture, Phil?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It seems a very dull one,&rdquo; said Phil, with a grimace.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, but I&rsquo;ve left out the transforming thing,&rdquo; said Anne softly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be love there, Phil&mdash;faithful, tender love, such as I&rsquo;ll never find anywhere else in the world&mdash;love that&rsquo;s waiting for me. That makes my picture a masterpiece, doesn&rsquo;t it, even if the colors are not very brilliant?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
