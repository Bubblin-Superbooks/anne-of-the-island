She had taken the pins out&mdash;they made her head ache, she said. The hectic flush was gone for the time, leaving her pale and childlike.</p><p>The moon rose in the silvery sky, empearling the clouds around her. Below, the pond shimmered in its hazy radiance. Just beyond the Gillis homestead was the church, with the old graveyard beside it. The moonlight shone on the white stones, bringing them out in clear-cut relief against the dark trees behind.</p><p>&ldquo;How strange the graveyard looks by moonlight!&rdquo; said Ruby suddenly. &ldquo;How ghostly!&rdquo; she shuddered. &ldquo;Anne, it won&rsquo;t be long now before I&rsquo;ll be lying over there.</p></div> </div>
