I&rsquo;m going to visit with Phil in Bolingbroke before I go home. You&rsquo;ll be in Avonlea before I will.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, I shall not be in Avonlea at all this summer, Anne. I&rsquo;ve been offered a job in the Daily News office and I&rsquo;m going to take it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Anne vaguely. She wondered what a whole Avonlea summer would be like without Gilbert. Somehow she did not like the prospect. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she concluded flatly, &ldquo;it is a good thing for you, of course.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
