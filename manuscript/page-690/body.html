You&rsquo;re too good to lose. If I can&rsquo;t have you for a sister I mean to keep you as a chum anyway. And don&rsquo;t fret over Roy. He is feeling terribly just now&mdash;I have to listen to his outpourings every day&mdash;but he&rsquo;ll get over it. He always does.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;ALWAYS?&rdquo; said Anne with a slight change of voice. &ldquo;So he has &lsquo;got over it&rsquo; before?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dear me, yes,&rdquo; said Dorothy frankly. &ldquo;Twice before. And he raved to me just the same both times. Not that the others actually refused him&mdash;they simply announced their engagements to some one else.</p></div> </div>
