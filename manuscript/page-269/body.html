<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Well, anyway, it&rsquo;s a perfectly elegant story, Anne, and will make you famous, of that I&rsquo;m sure. Have you got a title for it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I decided on the title long ago. I call it AVERIL&rsquo;S ATONEMENT. Doesn&rsquo;t that sound nice and alliterative? Now, Diana, tell me candidly, do you see any faults in my story?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; hesitated Diana, &ldquo;that part where AVERIL makes the cake doesn&rsquo;t seem to me quite romantic enough to match the rest. It&rsquo;s just what anybody might do. Heroines shouldn&rsquo;t do cooking, I think.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why, that is where the humor comes in, and it&rsquo;s one of the best parts of the whole story,&rdquo; said Anne. And it may be stated that in this she was quite right.</p></div> </div>
