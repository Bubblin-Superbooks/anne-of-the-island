I am sure if I came into this room fifty years from now it would say &lsquo;Anne, Anne&rsquo; to me. What nice times we&rsquo;ve had here, honey! What chats and jokes and good chummy jamborees! Oh, dear me! I&rsquo;m to marry Jo in June and I know I will be rapturously happy. But just now I feel as if I wanted this lovely Redmond life to go on forever.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m unreasonable enough just now to wish that, too,&rdquo; admitted Anne. &ldquo;No matter what deeper joys may come to us later on we&rsquo;ll never again have just the same delightful, irresponsible existence we&rsquo;ve had here. It&rsquo;s over forever, Phil.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
