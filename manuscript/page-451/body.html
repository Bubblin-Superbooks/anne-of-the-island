<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The kitchen door opened. Marilla looked up expecting to see Mrs. Lynde. Anne stood before her, tall and starry-eyed, with her hands full of Mayflowers and violets.</p><p>&ldquo;Anne Shirley!&rdquo; exclaimed Marilla. For once in her life she was surprised out of her reserve; she caught her girl in her arms and crushed her and her flowers against her heart, kissing the bright hair and sweet face warmly. &ldquo;I never looked for you till tomorrow night. How did you get from Carmody?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Walked, dearest of Marillas. Haven&rsquo;t I done it a score of times in the Queen&rsquo;s days? The mailman is to bring my trunk tomorrow; I just got homesick all at once, and came a day earlier. And oh! I&rsquo;ve had such a lovely walk in the May twilight; I stopped by the barrens and picked these Mayflowers; I came through Violet-Vale; it&rsquo;s just a big bowlful of violets now&mdash;the dear, sky-tinted things. Smell them, Marilla&mdash;drink them in.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
