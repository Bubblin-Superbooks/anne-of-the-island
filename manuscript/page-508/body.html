<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Anne was trying the effect of a white orchid in her hair. Roy Gardner had sent her white orchids for the reception, and she knew no other Redmond girl would have them that night&mdash;when Phil came in with admiring gaze.</p><p>&ldquo;Anne, this is certainly your night for looking handsome. Nine nights out of ten I can easily outshine you. The tenth you blossom out suddenly into something that eclipses me altogether. How do you manage it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the dress, dear. Fine feathers.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t. The last evening you flamed out into beauty you wore your old blue flannel shirtwaist that Mrs. Lynde made you. If Roy hadn&rsquo;t already lost head and heart about you he certainly would tonight. But I don&rsquo;t like orchids on you, Anne. No; it isn&rsquo;t jealousy. Orchids don&rsquo;t seem to BELONG to you.</p></div> </div>
