We knew they were coming, so we painstakingly put out of sight or out of reach all Miss Ada&rsquo;s cushions. That very elaborate one with the raised embroidery I dropped on the floor in the corner behind the chair it was on. I thought it would be safe there. But would you believe it? Charlie Sloane made for that chair, noticed the cushion behind it, solemnly fished it up, and sat on it the whole evening. Such a wreck of a cushion as it was! Poor Miss Ada asked me today, still smiling, but oh, so reproachfully, why I had allowed it to be sat upon. I told her I hadn&rsquo;t&mdash;that it was a matter of predestination coupled with inveterate Sloanishness and I wasn&rsquo;t a match for both combined.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
