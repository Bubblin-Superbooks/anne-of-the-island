<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get away from twins, it seems,&rdquo; smiled Anne. &ldquo;Wherever I go they confront me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;re not twins now, dear. After they reached the age of thirty they never were twins again. Miss Hannah has grown old, not too gracefully, and Miss Ada has stayed thirty, less gracefully still. I don&rsquo;t know whether Miss Hannah can smile or not; I&rsquo;ve never caught her at it so far, but Miss Ada smiles all the time and that&rsquo;s worse. However, they&rsquo;re nice, kind souls, and they take two boarders every year because Miss Hannah&rsquo;s economical soul cannot bear to &lsquo;waste room space&rsquo;&mdash;not because they need to or have to, as Miss Ada has told me seven times since Saturday night. As for our rooms, I admit they are hall bedrooms, and mine does look out on the back yard.</p></div> </div>
