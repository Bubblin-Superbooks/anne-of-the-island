I never wanted anything so much in my life&mdash;and this floor is awfully hard.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s just one more thing,&rdquo; said Priscilla resolutely. &ldquo;You, Phil, as all Redmond knows, entertain callers almost every evening. Now, at Patty&rsquo;s Place we can&rsquo;t do that. We have decided that we shall be at home to our friends on Friday evenings only. If you come with us you&rsquo;ll have to abide by that rule.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, you don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll mind that, do you? Why, I&rsquo;m glad of it. I knew I should have had some such rule myself, but I hadn&rsquo;t enough decision to make it or stick to it. When I can shuffle off the responsibility on you it will be a real relief.</p></div> </div>
