Jo graduates from St. Columbia this spring, you know. Then he&rsquo;s going to take a little mission church down on Patterson Street in the slums. Fancy me in the slums! But I&rsquo;d go there or to Greenland&rsquo;s icy mountains with him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And this is the girl who would NEVER marry a man who wasn&rsquo;t rich,&rdquo; commented Anne to a young pine tree.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t cast up the follies of my youth to me. I shall be poor as gaily as I&rsquo;ve been rich. You&rsquo;ll see. I&rsquo;m going to learn how to cook and make over dresses. I&rsquo;ve learned how to market since I&rsquo;ve lived at Patty&rsquo;s Place; and once I taught a Sunday School class for a whole summer.</p></div> </div>
