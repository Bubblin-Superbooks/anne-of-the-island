Dora sat between them, diligently studying her lessons; but Davy was sitting tailor-fashion on the grass, looking as gloomy and depressed as his single dimple would let him.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d get tired of it,&rdquo; said Marilla, with a sigh.</p><p>&ldquo;I daresay; but just now I feel that it would take me a long time to get tired of it, if it were all as charming as today. Everything loves June. Davy-boy, why this melancholy November face in blossom-time?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
