I wouldn&rsquo;t want to marry anybody who was wicked, but I think I&rsquo;d like it if he COULD be wicked and WOULDN&rsquo;T. Now, Fred is HOPELESSLY good.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have more sense some day, I hope,&rdquo; said Marilla.</p><p>Marilla spoke rather bitterly. She was grievously disappointed. She knew Anne had refused Gilbert Blythe. Avonlea gossip buzzed over the fact, which had leaked out, nobody knew how. Perhaps Charlie Sloane had guessed and told his guesses for truth. Perhaps Diana had betrayed it to Fred and Fred had been indiscreet. At all events it was known; Mrs. Blythe no longer asked Anne, in public or private, if she had heard lately from Gilbert, but passed her by with a frosty bow.</p></div> </div>
