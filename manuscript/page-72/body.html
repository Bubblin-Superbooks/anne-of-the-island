Miss Hannah gravely told me we could have &lsquo;young gentlemen callers&rsquo; two evenings in the week, if they went away at a reasonable hour; and Miss Ada asked me, smiling, please to be sure they didn&rsquo;t sit on her beautiful cushions.

Miss Ada even has an elaborate Battenburg one on top of the piano.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
