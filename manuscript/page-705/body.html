<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I have just one memory of my mother and it is the sweetest of all my memories,&rdquo; said Mrs. Allan. &ldquo;I was five years old, and I had been allowed to go to school one day with my two older sisters. When school came out my sisters went home in different groups, each supposing I was with the other. Instead I had run off with a little girl I had played with at recess. We went to her home, which was near the school, and began making mud pies. We were having a glorious time when my older sister arrived, breathless and angry.</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You naughty girl&rdquo; she cried, snatching my reluctant hand and dragging me along with her. &lsquo;Come home this minute. Oh, you&rsquo;re going to catch it! Mother is awful cross. She is going to give you a good whipping.&rsquo;</p></div> </div>
