<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I suppose we&rsquo;ll get used to being grownup in time,&rdquo; said Anne cheerfully. &ldquo;There won&rsquo;t be so many unexpected things about it by and by&mdash;though, after all, I fancy it&rsquo;s the unexpected things that give spice to life. We&rsquo;re eighteen, Diana. In two more years we&rsquo;ll be twenty. When I was ten I thought twenty was a green old age. In no time you&rsquo;ll be a staid, middle-aged matron, and I shall be nice, old maid Aunt Anne, coming to visit you on vacations. You&rsquo;ll always keep a corner for me, won&rsquo;t you, Di darling? Not the spare room, of course&mdash;old maids can&rsquo;t aspire to spare rooms, and I shall be as &lsquo;umble as Uriah Heep, and quite content with a little over-the-porch or off-the-parlor cubby hole.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
