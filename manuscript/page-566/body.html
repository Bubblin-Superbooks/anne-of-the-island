<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Jane Ann married a rich man she didn&rsquo;t care anything about, and she hasn&rsquo;t the life of a dog. She come to see me last week and says, says she, &lsquo;Sarah Skinner, I envy you. I&rsquo;d rather live in a little hut on the side of the road with a man I was fond of than in my big house with the one I&rsquo;ve got.&rsquo; Jane Ann&rsquo;s man ain&rsquo;t such a bad sort, nuther, though he&rsquo;s so contrary that he wears his fur coat when the thermometer&rsquo;s at ninety. The only way to git him to do anything is to coax him to do the opposite. But there ain&rsquo;t any love to smooth things down and it&rsquo;s a poor way of living. Jog along, black mare. There&rsquo;s Janet&rsquo;s place in the hollow&mdash;&lsquo;Wayside,&rsquo; she calls it. Quite pictureaskew, ain&rsquo;t it? I guess you&rsquo;ll be glad to git out of this, with all them mail bags jamming round you.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
