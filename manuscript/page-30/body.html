<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Cause I don&rsquo;t think it would be nice to talk to God before strangers, Anne. Dora can say hers to Mrs. Lynde if she likes, but I won&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ll wait till she&rsquo;s gone and then say &lsquo;em. Won&rsquo;t that be all right, Anne?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, if you are sure you won&rsquo;t forget to say them, Davy-boy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I won&rsquo;t forget, you bet. I think saying my prayers is great fun. But it won&rsquo;t be as good fun saying them alone as saying them to you. I wish you&rsquo;d stay home, Anne. I don&rsquo;t see what you want to go away and leave us for.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
