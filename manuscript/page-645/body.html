<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My mother and sisters are coming to call on you,&rdquo; said Roy quietly.</p><p>Something went over Anne which might be described as a thrill, but it was hardly a pleasant one. She had never met any of Roy&rsquo;s family; she realized the significance of his statement; and it had, somehow, an irrevocableness about it that chilled her.</p><p>&ldquo;I shall be glad to see them,&rdquo; she said flatly; and then wondered if she really would be glad. She ought to be, of course. But would it not be something of an ordeal? Gossip had filtered to Anne regarding the light in which the Gardners viewed the &ldquo;infatuation&rdquo; of son and brother. Roy must have brought pressure to bear in the matter of this call. Anne knew she would be weighed in the balance.</p></div> </div>
