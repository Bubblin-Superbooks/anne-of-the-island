<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;What is it to be about?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know yet. I want to get hold of a good plot. I believe this is very necessary from an editor&rsquo;s point of view. The only thing I&rsquo;ve settled on is the heroine&rsquo;s name. It is to be AVERIL LESTER. Rather pretty, don&rsquo;t you think? Don&rsquo;t mention this to any one, Diana. I haven&rsquo;t told anybody but you and Mr. Harrison. HE wasn&rsquo;t very encouraging&mdash;he said there was far too much trash written nowadays as it was, and he&rsquo;d expected something better of me, after a year at college.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
