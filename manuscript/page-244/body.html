She&rsquo;s Mrs. Samson Coates of Spencervale&mdash;Mrs. Elisha Wright&rsquo;s aunt. She&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s aunt, too. Her husband died last winter and she was left very poor and lonely, so the Wrights took her to live with them. Mother thought we ought to take her, but father put his foot down. Live with Aunt Atossa he would not.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
