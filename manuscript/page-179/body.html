Goodness, what DID she think of Billy Andrews? She had never thought ANYTHING about him&mdash;round-faced, stupid, perpetually smiling, good-natured Billy Andrews. Did ANYBODY ever think about Billy Andrews?</p><p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t understand, Jane,&rdquo; she stammered. &ldquo;What do you mean&mdash;exactly?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you like Billy?&rdquo; asked Jane bluntly.</p><p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;why&mdash;yes, I like him, of course,&rdquo; gasped Anne, wondering if she were telling the literal truth. Certainly she did not DISlike Billy. But could the indifferent tolerance with which she regarded him, when he happened to be in her range of vision, be considered positive enough for liking? WHAT was Jane trying to elucidate?</p></div> </div>
