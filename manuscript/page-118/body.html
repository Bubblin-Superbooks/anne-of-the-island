<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I really ought to hate you and instead I love you madly, and I&rsquo;m miserable if I don&rsquo;t see you every day. You&rsquo;re different from any girl I ever knew before. When you look at me in a certain way I feel what an insignificant, frivolous little beast I am, and I long to be better and wiser and stronger. And then I make good resolutions; but the first nice-looking mannie who comes my way knocks them all out of my head. Isn&rsquo;t college life magnificent? It&rsquo;s so funny to think I hated it that first day. But if I hadn&rsquo;t I might never got really acquainted with you. Anne, please tell me over again that you like me a little bit. I yearn to hear it.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
