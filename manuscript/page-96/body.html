<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;We thought this morning that you were the prettiest girl we saw at Redmond.&rdquo;</p><p>Philippa&rsquo;s crooked mouth flashed into a bewitching, crooked smile over very white little teeth.</p><p>&ldquo;I thought that myself,&rdquo; was her next astounding statement, &ldquo;but I wanted some one else&rsquo;s opinion to bolster mine up. I can&rsquo;t decide even on my own appearance. Just as soon as I&rsquo;ve decided that I&rsquo;m pretty I begin to feel miserably that I&rsquo;m not. Besides, have a horrible old great-aunt who is always saying to me, with a mournful sigh, &lsquo;You were such a pretty baby. It&rsquo;s strange how children change when they grow up.&rsquo; I adore aunts, but I detest great-aunts. Please tell me quite often that I am pretty, if you don&rsquo;t mind. I feel so much more comfortable when I can believe I&rsquo;m pretty.</p></div> </div>
