<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Aunt Jamesina says I&rsquo;ll ruin Jo&rsquo;s career if I marry him. But I won&rsquo;t. I know I haven&rsquo;t much sense or sobriety, but I&rsquo;ve got what is ever so much better&mdash;the knack of making people like me. There is a man in Bolingbroke who lisps and always testifies in prayer-meeting. He says, &lsquo;If you can&rsquo;t thine like an electric thtar thine like a candlethtick.&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll be Jo&rsquo;s little candlestick.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Phil, you&rsquo;re incorrigible. Well, I love you so much that I can&rsquo;t make nice, light, congratulatory little speeches. But I&rsquo;m heart-glad of your happiness.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
