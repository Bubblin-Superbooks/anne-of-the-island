<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I know. You HAVE helped me already. Nothing seems quite so dreadful now. Good night, Anne.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good night, dear.&rdquo;</p><p>Anne walked home very slowly in the moonlight. The evening had changed something for her. Life held a different meaning, a deeper purpose. On the surface it would go on just the same; but the deeps had been stirred. It must not be with her as with poor butterfly Ruby. When she came to the end of one life it must not be to face the next with the shrinking terror of something wholly different&mdash;something for which accustomed thought and ideal and aspiration had unfitted her. The little things of life, sweet and excellent in their place, must not be the things lived for; the highest must be sought and followed; the life of heaven must be begun here on earth.</p></div> </div>
