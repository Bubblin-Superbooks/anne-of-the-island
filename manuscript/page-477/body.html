<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I suppose you wonder what I&rsquo;m doing at Prospect Point. Well, I always like to spend a month of summer at the shore, and father insists that I come to his second-cousin Emily&rsquo;s &lsquo;select boardinghouse&rsquo; at Prospect Point. So a fortnight ago I came as usual. And as usual old &lsquo;Uncle Mark Miller&rsquo; brought me from the station with his ancient buggy and what he calls his &lsquo;generous purpose&rsquo; horse. He is a nice old man and gave me a handful of pink peppermints. Peppermints always seem to me such a religious sort of candy&mdash;I suppose because when I was a little girl Grandmother Gordon always gave them to me in church. Once I asked, referring to the smell of peppermints, &lsquo;Is that the odor of sanctity?&rsquo; I didn&rsquo;t like to eat Uncle Mark&rsquo;</p></div> </div>
