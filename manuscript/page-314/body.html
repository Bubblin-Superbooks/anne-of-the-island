<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Anne was sitting with Ruby Gillis in the Gillis&rsquo; garden after the day had crept lingeringly through it and was gone. It had been a warm, smoky summer afternoon. The world was in a splendor of out-flowering. The idle valleys were full of hazes. The woodways were pranked with shadows and the fields with the purple of the asters.</p><p>Anne had given up a moonlight drive to the White Sands beach that she might spend the evening with Ruby. She had so spent many evenings that summer, although she often wondered what good it did any one, and sometimes went home deciding that she could not go again.</p><p>Ruby grew paler as the summer waned; the White Sands school was given up&mdash;&ldquo;her father thought it better that she shouldn&rsquo;t teach till New Year&rsquo;s&rdquo;&mdash;</p></div> </div>
