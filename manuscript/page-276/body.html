<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A week of delightful dreaming followed, and then came a bitter awakening. One evening Diana found Anne in the porch gable, with suspicious-looking eyes. On the table lay a long envelope and a crumpled manuscript.</p><p>&ldquo;Anne, your story hasn&rsquo;t come back?&rdquo; cried Diana incredulously.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, it has,&rdquo; said Anne shortly.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, that editor must be crazy. What reason did he give?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No reason at all. There is just a printed slip saying that it wasn&rsquo;t found acceptable.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I never thought much of that magazine, anyway,&rdquo; said Diana hotly. &ldquo;The stories in it are not half as interesting as those in the Canadian Woman, although it costs so much more. I suppose the editor is prejudiced against any one who isn&rsquo;t a Yankee. Don&rsquo;t be discouraged, Anne. Remember how Mrs. Morgan&rsquo;s stories came back. Send yours to the Canadian Woman.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
