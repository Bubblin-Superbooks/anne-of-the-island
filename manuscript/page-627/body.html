<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Tell us about your beaux, Aunty,&rdquo; entreated Phil. &ldquo;You must have had any number of them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not in the past tense,&rdquo; retorted Aunt Jamesina. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got them yet. There are three old widowers at home who have been casting sheep&rsquo;s eyes at me for some time. You children needn&rsquo;t think you own all the romance in the world.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Widowers and sheep&rsquo;s eyes don&rsquo;t sound very romantic, Aunty.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, no; but young folks aren&rsquo;t always romantic either. Some of my beaux certainly weren&rsquo;t. I used to laugh at them scandalous, poor boys. There was Jim Elwood&mdash;he was always in a sort of day-dream&mdash;never seemed to sense what was going on. He didn&rsquo;t wake up to the fact that I&rsquo;d said &lsquo;no&rsquo; till a year after I&rsquo;d said it.</p></div> </div>
