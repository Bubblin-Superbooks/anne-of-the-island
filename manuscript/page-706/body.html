<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I had never been whipped. Dread and terror filled my poor little heart. I have never been so miserable in my life as I was on that walk home. I had not meant to be naughty. Phemy Cameron had asked me to go home with her and I had not known it was wrong to go. And now I was to be whipped for it. When we got home my sister dragged me into the kitchen where mother was sitting by the fire in the twilight. My poor wee legs were trembling so that I could hardly stand. And mother&mdash;mother just took me up in her arms, without one word of rebuke or harshness, kissed me and held me close to her heart. &lsquo;I was so frightened you were lost, darling,&rsquo; she said tenderly. I could see the love shining in her eyes as she looked down on me. She never scolded or reproached me for what I had done&mdash;only told me I must never go away again without asking permission. She died very soon afterwards. That is the only memory I have of her. Isn&rsquo;t it a beautiful one?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
