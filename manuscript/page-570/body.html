<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Anne Shirley to Philippa Gordon, greeting.</p><p>&ldquo;Well-beloved, it&rsquo;s high time I was writing you. Here am I, installed once more as a country &lsquo;schoolma&rsquo;am&rsquo; at Valley Road, boarding at &lsquo;Wayside,&rsquo; the home of Miss Janet Sweet. Janet is a dear soul and very nicelooking; tall, but not over-tall; stoutish, yet with a certain restraint of outline suggestive of a thrifty soul who is not going to be overlavish even in the matter of avoirdupois. She has a knot of soft, crimpy, brown hair with a thread of gray in it, a sunny face with rosy cheeks, and big, kind eyes as blue as forget-me-nots. Moreover, she is one of those delightful, old-fashioned cooks who don&rsquo;t care a bit if they ruin your digestion as long as they can give you feasts of fat things.</p></div> </div>
