<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The firelight shadows were dancing over the kitchen walls at Green Gables, for the spring evening was chilly; through the open east window drifted in the subtly sweet voices of the night. Marilla was sitting by the fire&mdash;at least, in body. In spirit she was roaming olden ways, with feet grown young. Of late Marilla had thus spent many an hour, when she thought she should have been knitting for the twins.</p><p>&ldquo;I suppose I&rsquo;m growing old,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>Yet Marilla had changed but little in the past nine years, save to grow something thinner, and even more angular; there was a little more gray in the hair that was still twisted up in the same hard knot, with two hairpins&mdash;WERE they the same hairpins?&mdash;still stuck through it.</p></div> </div>
