And of course that&rsquo;s Charlie Sloane. HE hasn&rsquo;t changed&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t! He looked just like that when he was born, and he&rsquo;ll look like that when he&rsquo;s eighty. This way, dear. We&rsquo;ll be home in twenty minutes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Home!&rdquo; groaned Anne. &ldquo;You mean we&rsquo;ll be in some horrible boardinghouse, in a still more horrible hall bedroom, looking out on a dingy back yard.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a horrible boardinghouse, Anne-girl. Here&rsquo;s our cab. Hop in&mdash;the driver will get your trunk. Oh, yes, the boardinghouse&mdash;it&rsquo;s really a very nice place of its kind, as you&rsquo;ll admit tomorrow morning when a good night&rsquo;</p></div> </div>
