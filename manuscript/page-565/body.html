But he&rsquo;s going to see a skinny old maid in Millersville now, and I guess she&rsquo;ll take him fast enough. She&rsquo;ll make him a better wife than his first did. W.O. never wanted to marry her. He just asked her to marry him &lsquo;cause his father wanted him to, never dreaming but that she&rsquo;d say &lsquo;no.&rsquo; But mind you, she said &lsquo;yes.&rsquo; There was a predicament for you. Jog along, black mare. She was a great housekeeper, but most awful mean. She wore the same bonnet for eighteen years. Then she got a new one and W.O. met her on the road and didn&rsquo;t know her. Jog along, black mare. I feel that I&rsquo;d a narrer escape. I might have married him and been most awful miserable, like my poor cousin, Jane Ann.</p></div> </div>
