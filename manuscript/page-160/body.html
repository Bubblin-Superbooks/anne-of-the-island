<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Nothing, after all, could compare with old ties, old friends, and old Green Gables! How starry Anne&rsquo;s eyes were as they sat down to the loaded supper table, how pink her cheeks, how silver-clear her laughter! And Diana was going to stay all night, too. How like the dear old times it was! And the rose-bud tea-set graced the table! With Marilla the force of nature could no further go.</p><p>&ldquo;I suppose you and Diana will now proceed to talk all night,&rdquo; said Marilla sarcastically, as the girls went upstairs. Marilla was always sarcastic after any self-betrayal.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Anne gaily, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m going to put Davy to bed first. He insists on that.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
