I want to be chummy with you. I&rsquo;ve taken such a fancy to you both. And I haven&rsquo;t quite disgusted you with my frivolity, have I?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not quite,&rdquo; laughed Anne, responding to Phil&rsquo;s squeeze, with a return of cordiality.</p><p>&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m not half so silly as I seem on the surface, you know. You just accept Philippa Gordon, as the Lord made her, with all her faults, and I believe you&rsquo;ll come to like her. Isn&rsquo;t this graveyard a sweet place? I&rsquo;d love to be buried here.</p></div> </div>
