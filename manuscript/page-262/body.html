<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you have changed her name?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, the thing was impossible. I tried to, but I couldn&rsquo;t do it, any more than I could change yours. AVERIL was so real to me that no matter what other name I tried to give her I just thought of her as AVERIL behind it all. But finally I got a plot that matched her. Then came the excitement of choosing names for all my characters. You have no idea how fascinating that is. I&rsquo;ve lain awake for hours thinking over those names. The hero&rsquo;s name is PERCEVAL DALRYMPLE.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Have you named ALL the characters?&rdquo; asked Diana wistfully. &ldquo;If you hadn&rsquo;t I was going to ask you to let me name one&mdash;just some unimportant person. I&rsquo;d feel as if I had a share in the story then.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
