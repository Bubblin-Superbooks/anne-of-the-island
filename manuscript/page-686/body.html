<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;There is no need, Phil. I&rsquo;m in the dust. This has spoiled everything backwards. I can never think of Redmond days without recalling the humiliation of this evening. Roy despises me&mdash;and you despise me&mdash;and I despise myself.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You poor darling,&rdquo; said Phil, melting. &ldquo;Just come here and let me comfort you. I&rsquo;ve no right to scold you. I&rsquo;d have married Alec or Alonzo if I hadn&rsquo;t met Jo. Oh, Anne, things are so mixed-up in real life. They aren&rsquo;t clear-cut and trimmed off, as they are in novels.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I hope that NO one will ever again ask me to marry him as long as I live,&rdquo; sobbed poor Anne, devoutly believing that she meant it.</p></div> </div>
