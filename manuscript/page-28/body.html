<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t crying &lsquo;cause Dora fell down cellar,&rdquo; said Davy, cutting short Anne&rsquo;s wellmeant preachment with increasing bitterness. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m crying, cause I wasn&rsquo;t there to see her fall. I&rsquo;m always missing some fun or other, seems to me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Davy!&rdquo; Anne choked back an unholy shriek of laughter. &ldquo;Would you call it fun to see poor little Dora fall down the steps and get hurt?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She wasn&rsquo;t MUCH hurt,&rdquo; said Davy, defiantly. &ldquo;&lsquo;Course, if she&rsquo;d been killed I&rsquo;d have been real sorry, Anne. But the Keiths ain&rsquo;t so easy killed. They&rsquo;re like the Blewetts, I guess. Herb Blewett fell off the hayloft last Wednesday, and rolled right down through the turnip chute into the box stall, where they had a fearful wild, cross horse, and rolled right under his heels.</p></div> </div>
