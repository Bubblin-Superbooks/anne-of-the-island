Gilbert, now, looked as much like a man in them as in his own proper habiliments.&rdquo;</p><p>Anne and Priscilla found themselves in the thick of the social life of Redmond.

Philippa was the daughter of a rich and well-known man, and belonged to an old and exclusive &ldquo;Bluenose&rdquo; family. This, combined with her beauty and charm&mdash;a charm acknowledged by all who met her&mdash;promptly opened the gates of all cliques, clubs and classes in Redmond to her; and where she went Anne and Priscilla went, too. Phil &ldquo;adored&rdquo; Anne and Priscilla, especially Anne. She was a loyal little soul, crystal-free from any form of snobbishness.</p></div> </div>
