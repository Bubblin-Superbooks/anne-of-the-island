<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> It&rsquo;s a horrible feeling, isn&rsquo;t it? In Bolingbroke I&rsquo;m an important personage, and in Kingsport I&rsquo;m just nobody! There were times when I could feel my soul turning a delicate blue. Where do you hang out?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thirty-eight St. John&rsquo;s Street.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Better and better. Why, I&rsquo;m just around the corner on Wallace Street. I don&rsquo;t like my boardinghouse, though. It&rsquo;s bleak and lonesome, and my room looks out on such an unholy back yard. It&rsquo;s the ugliest place in the world. As for cats&mdash;well, surely ALL the Kingsport cats can&rsquo;t congregate there at night, but half of them must. I adore cats on hearth rugs, snoozing before nice, friendly fires, but cats in back yards at midnight are totally different animals. The first night I was here I cried all night, and so did the cats. You should have seen my nose in the morning. How I wished I had never left home!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
