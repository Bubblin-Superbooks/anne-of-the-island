One by one, sooner or later, all the rest of us must follow.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I suppose so,&rdquo; said Diana uncomfortably. She did not want to talk of that. She would have preferred to have discussed the details of the funeral&mdash;the splendid white velvet casket Mr. Gillis had insisted on having for Ruby&mdash;&ldquo;the Gillises must always make a splurge, even at funerals,&rdquo; quoth Mrs. Rachel Lynde&mdash;Herb Spencer&rsquo;s sad face, the uncontrolled, hysteric grief of one of Ruby&rsquo;s sisters&mdash;but Anne would not talk of these things. She seemed wrapped in a reverie in which Diana felt lonesomely that she had neither lot nor part.</p></div> </div>
