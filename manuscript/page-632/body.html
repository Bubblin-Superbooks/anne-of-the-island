<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Oh, my mind agrees with you, Anne. But my soul remains doleful and uninspired. I&rsquo;m always grubby and dingy on rainy nights.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Some nights I like the rain&mdash;I like to lie in bed and hear it pattering on the roof and drifting through the pines.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I like it when it stays on the roof,&rdquo; said Stella. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t always. I spent a gruesome night in an old country farmhouse last summer. The roof leaked and the rain came pattering down on my bed. There was no poetry in THAT. I had to get up in the &lsquo;mirk midnight&rsquo; and chivy round to pull the bedstead out of the drip&mdash;and it was one of those solid, old-fashioned beds that weigh a ton&mdash;more or less. And then that drip-drop, drip-drop kept up all night until my nerves just went to pieces.</p></div> </div>
