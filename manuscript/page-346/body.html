<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Why, Anne, what is the matter? I expected to find you radiant over winning Rollings Reliable prize. Good for you!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Gilbert, not you,&rdquo; implored Anne, in an ET-TU BRUTE tone. &ldquo;I thought YOU would understand. Can&rsquo;t you see how awful it is?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I must confess I can&rsquo;t. WHAT is wrong?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Everything,&rdquo; moaned Anne. &ldquo;I feel as if I were disgraced forever. What do you think a mother would feel like if she found her child tattooed over with a baking powder advertisement? I feel just the same. I loved my poor little story, and I wrote it out of the best that was in me. And it is SACRILEGE to have it degraded to the level of a baking powder advertisement.</p></div> </div>
