<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Phil, you&rsquo;re not really frivolous,&rdquo; said Anne gravely. &ldquo;&lsquo;Way down underneath that frivolous exterior of yours you&rsquo;ve got a dear, loyal, womanly little soul. Why do you hide it so?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it, Queen Anne. You are right&mdash;I&rsquo;m not frivolous at heart. But there&rsquo;s a sort of frivolous skin over my soul and I can&rsquo;t take it off. As Mrs. Poyser says, I&rsquo;d have to be hatched over again and hatched different before I could change it. But Jonas knows the real me and loves me, frivolity and all. And I love him. I never was so surprised in my life as I was when I found out I loved him. I&rsquo;d never thought it possible to fall in love with an ugly man. Fancy me coming down to one solitary beau. And one named Jonas! But I mean to call him Jo. That&rsquo;s such a nice, crisp little name. I couldn&rsquo;t nickname Alonzo.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
