She is changed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Paul, it is you who are changed,&rdquo; said Anne. &ldquo;You have grown too old for the Rock People. They like only children for playfellows. I am afraid the Twin Sailors will never again come to you in the pearly, enchanted boat with the sail of moonshine; and the Golden Lady will play no more for you on her golden harp. Even Nora will not meet you much longer. You must pay the penalty of growing-up, Paul. You must leave fairyland behind you.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
