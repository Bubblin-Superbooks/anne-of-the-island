<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Time!&rdquo; said Janet with indescribable scorn. &ldquo;He has had twenty years. How much time does he want?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you mean that John Douglas has been coming to see you for twenty years?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He has. And he has never so much as mentioned marriage to me. And I don&rsquo;t believe he ever will now. I&rsquo;ve never said a word to a mortal about it, but it seems to me I&rsquo;ve just got to talk it out with some one at last or go crazy. John Douglas begun to go with me twenty years ago, before mother died. Well, he kept coming and coming, and after a spell I begun making quilts and things; but he never said anything about getting married, only just kept coming and coming. There wasn&rsquo;t anything I could do. Mother died when we&rsquo;d been going together for eight years. I thought he maybe would speak out then, seeing as I was left alone in the world.</p></div> </div>
