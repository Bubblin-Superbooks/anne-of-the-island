Everybody on Patterson Street uses slang&mdash;that is to say, metaphorical language&mdash;and if I didn&rsquo;t they would think me insufferably proud and stuck up.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Have you broken the news to your family?&rdquo; asked Priscilla, feeding the Sarah-cat bits from her lunchbasket.</p><p>Phil nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;How did they take it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, mother rampaged. But I stood rockfirm&mdash;even I, Philippa Gordon, who never before could hold fast to anything. Father was calmer. Father&rsquo;s own daddy was a minister, so you see he has a soft spot in his heart for the cloth. I had Jo up to Mount Holly, after mother grew calm, and they both loved him.</p></div> </div>
