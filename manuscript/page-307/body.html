<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;That was your conscience punishing you, Davy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s my conscience? I want to know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s something in you, Davy, that always tells you when you are doing wrong and makes you unhappy if you persist in doing it. Haven&rsquo;t you noticed that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, but I didn&rsquo;t know what it was. I wish I didn&rsquo;t have it. I&rsquo;d have lots more fun. Where is my conscience, Anne? I want to know. Is it in my stomach?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s in your soul,&rdquo; answered Anne, thankful for the darkness, since gravity must be preserved in serious matters.</p></div> </div>
