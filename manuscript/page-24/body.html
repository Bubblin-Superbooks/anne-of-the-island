Remembrance wove a sweet and subtle spell over the two young creatures.</p><p>&ldquo;You are very quiet, Anne,&rdquo; said Gilbert at last.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid to speak or move for fear all this wonderful beauty will vanish just like a broken silence,&rdquo; breathed Anne.</p><p>Gilbert suddenly laid his hand over the slender white one lying on the rail of the bridge. His hazel eyes deepened into darkness, his still boyish lips opened to say something of the dream and hope that thrilled his soul. But Anne snatched her hand away and turned quickly. The spell of the dusk was broken for her.</p></div> </div>
