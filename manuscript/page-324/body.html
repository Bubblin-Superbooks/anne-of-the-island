<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Ruby sank back on her pillows and sobbed convulsively. Anne pressed her hand in an agony of sympathy&mdash;silent sympathy, which perhaps helped Ruby more than broken, imperfect words could have done; for presently she grew calmer and her sobs ceased.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;ve told you this, Anne,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;It has helped me just to say it all out. I&rsquo;ve wanted to all summer&mdash;every time you came. I wanted to talk it over with you&mdash;but I COULDN&rsquo;T. It seemed as if it would make death so SURE if I SAID I was going to die, or if any one else said it or hinted it. I wouldn&rsquo;t say it, or even think it. In the daytime, when people were around me and everything was cheerful, it wasn&rsquo;t so hard to keep from thinking of it. But in the night, when I couldn&rsquo;t sleep&mdash;it was so dreadful, Anne. I couldn&rsquo;t get away from it then. Death just came and stared me in the face, until I got so frightened I could have screamed.</p></div> </div>
