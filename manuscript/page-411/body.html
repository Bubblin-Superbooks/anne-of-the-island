<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Amid Anne&rsquo;s peal of laughter Phil came downstairs, trailing clouds of glory, and surveyed herself in the long oval mirror on the wall.</p><p>&ldquo;A flattering looking glass is a promoter of amiability,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The one in my room does certainly make me green. Do I look pretty nice, Anne?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you really know how pretty you are, Phil?&rdquo; asked Anne, in honest admiration.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course I do. What are looking glasses and men for? That wasn&rsquo;t what I meant. Are all my ends tucked in? Is my skirt straight? And would this rose look better lower down? I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s too high&mdash;it will make me look lop-sided. But I hate things tickling my ears.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
