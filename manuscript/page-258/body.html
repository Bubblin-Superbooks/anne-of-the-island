<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Come up often, won&rsquo;t you, Anne?&rdquo; whispered Ruby. &ldquo;Come alone&mdash;I want you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you feeling quite well, Ruby?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Me! Why, I&rsquo;m perfectly well. I never felt better in my life. Of course, that congestion last winter pulled me down a little. But just see my color. I don&rsquo;t look much like an invalid, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p><p>Ruby&rsquo;s voice was almost sharp. She pulled her arm away from Anne, as if in resentment, and ran downstairs, where she was gayer than ever, apparently so much absorbed in bantering her two swains that Diana and Anne felt rather out of it and soon went away.</p></div> </div>
