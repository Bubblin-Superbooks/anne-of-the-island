I stood up and shook myself, and then looked on the floor. The car was full of people, who were going home from the opera, and they all stared at me, but I was past caring for a little thing like that.</p><p>&ldquo;But I could not find my fare. I concluded I must have put it in my mouth and swallowed it inadvertently.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know what to do. Would the conductor, I wondered, stop the car and put me off in ignominy and shame? Was it possible that I could convince him that I was merely the victim of my own absentmindedness, and not an unprincipled creature trying to obtain a ride upon false pretenses? How I wished that Alec or Alonzo were there. But they weren&rsquo;t because I wanted them.</p></div> </div>
