He thought she looked a little pale when she came out of the coeds&rsquo; dressing room; but as they entered the reception room her color and sparkle suddenly returned to her. She turned to Roy with her gayest expression. He smiled back at her with what Phil called &ldquo;his deep, black, velvety smile.&rdquo; Yet she really did not see Roy at all.

A tall girl, with large dark-blue eyes, ivory outlines, and a gloss of darkness on her smooth hair.</p></div> </div>
