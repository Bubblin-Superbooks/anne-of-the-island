<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Anne looked across the still, white fields, cold and lifeless in the harsh light of that grim sunset, and sighed. She was very lonely; and she was sad at heart; for she was wondering if she would be able to return to Redmond next year. It did not seem likely. The only scholarship possible in the Sophomore year was a very small affair. She would not take Marilla&rsquo;s money; and there seemed little prospect of being able to earn enough in the summer vacation.</p><p>&ldquo;I suppose I&rsquo;ll just have to drop out next year,&rdquo; she thought drearily, &ldquo;and teach a district school again until I earn enough to finish my course. And by that time all my old class will have graduated and Patty&rsquo;s Place will be out of the question. But there! I&rsquo;m not going to be a coward. I&rsquo;m thankful I can earn my way through if necessary.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
