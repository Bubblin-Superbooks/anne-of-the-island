Did they pay you for it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes; they&rsquo;ve sent a check for ten dollars, and the editor writes that he would like to see more of my work. Dear man, he shall. It was an old sketch I found in my box. I re-wrote it and sent it in&mdash;but I never really thought it could be accepted because it had no plot,&rdquo; said Anne, recalling the bitter experience of Averil&rsquo;s Atonement.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you going to do with that ten dollars, Anne? Let&rsquo;s all go up town and get drunk,&rdquo; suggested Phil.</p></div> </div>
