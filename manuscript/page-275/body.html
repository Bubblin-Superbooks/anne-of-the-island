<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>One day Anne took to the Post Office a long, bulky envelope, addressed, with the delightful confidence of youth and inexperience, to the very biggest of the &ldquo;big&rdquo; magazines. Diana was as excited over it as Anne herself.</p><p>&ldquo;How long do you suppose it will be before you hear from it?&rdquo; she asked.</p><p>&ldquo;It shouldn&rsquo;t be longer than a fortnight. Oh, how happy and proud I shall be if it is accepted!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course it will be accepted, and they will likely ask you to send them more. You may be as famous as Mrs. Morgan some day, Anne, and then how proud I&rsquo;ll be of knowing you,&rdquo; said Diana, who possessed, at least, the striking merit of an unselfish admiration of the gifts and graces of her friends.</p></div> </div>
