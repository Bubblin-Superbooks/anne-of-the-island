I&rsquo;ll sit on one of those old slabs and shut my eyes and imagine I&rsquo;m in the Avonlea woods.&rdquo;</p><p>Anne did not do that, however, for she found enough of interest in Old St. John&rsquo;s to keep her eyes wide open. They went in by the entrance gates, past the simple, massive, stone arch surmounted by the great lion of England.</p></div> </div>
