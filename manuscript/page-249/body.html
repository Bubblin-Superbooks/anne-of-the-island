<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;We want to run in and see Ruby Gillis a little while,&rdquo; explained Diana.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, anything does for an excuse, of course,&rdquo; said Aunt Atossa, amiably. &ldquo;Just whip in and whip out before you have time to say how-do decently. It&rsquo;s college airs, I s&rsquo;pose. You&rsquo;d be wiser to keep away from Ruby Gillis. The doctors say consumption&rsquo;s catching. I always knew Ruby&rsquo;d get something, gadding off to Boston last fall for a visit. People who ain&rsquo;t content to stay home always catch something.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;People who don&rsquo;t go visiting catch things, too. Sometimes they even die,&rdquo; said Diana solemnly.</p></div> </div>
