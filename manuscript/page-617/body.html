So we mustn&rsquo;t speak evil of her. But I&rsquo;m happy at last, Anne. And I wouldn&rsquo;t have minded waiting so long a bit if I&rsquo;d only known why.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;When are you to be married?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Next month. Of course it will be very quiet. I suppose people will talk terrible. They&rsquo;ll say I made enough haste to snap John up as soon as his poor mother was out of the way. John wanted to let them know the truth but I said, &lsquo;No, John; after all she was your mother, and we&rsquo;ll keep the secret between us, and not cast any shadow on her memory. I don&rsquo;t mind what people say, now that I know the truth myself.</p></div> </div>
