<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;The parlor is tiny and neat. Its one window is so shaded by a huge willow that the room has a grotto-like effect of emerald gloom. There are wonderful tidies on the chairs, and gay mats on the floor, and books and cards carefully arranged on a round table, and vases of dried grass on the mantel-piece. Between the vases is a cheerful decoration of preserved coffin plates&mdash;five in all, pertaining respectively to Janet&rsquo;s father and mother, a brother, her sister Anne, and a hired man who died here once! If I go suddenly insane some of these days &lsquo;know all men by these presents&rsquo; that those coffin-plates have caused it.</p><p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s all delightful and I said so. Janet loved me for it, just as she detested poor Esther because Esther had said so much shade was unhygienic and had objected to sleeping on a feather bed.</p></div> </div>
