<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> You can always trust Mrs. Lilly to tell you cheerful things like that. I have a horror of scarlet fever. I couldn&rsquo;t sleep when I went to bed for thinking of it. I tossed and tumbled about, dreaming fearful dreams when I did snooze for a minute; and at three I wakened up with a high fever, a sore throat, and a raging headache. I knew I had scarlet fever; I got up in a panic and hunted up Cousin Emily&rsquo;s &lsquo;doctor book&rsquo; to read up the symptoms. Anne, I had them all. So I went back to bed, and knowing the worst, slept like a top the rest of the night. Though why a top should sleep sounder than anything else I never could understand. But this morning I was quite well, so it couldn&rsquo;t have been the fever. I suppose if I did catch it last night it couldn&rsquo;t have developed so soon. I can remember that in daytime, but at three o&rsquo;clock at night I never can be logical.</p></div> </div>
