That Gilbert of yours is a darling, Anne, but why does he go around so much with Goggle-eyes?&rdquo;</p><p>Anne stiffened. She had no great liking for Charlie Sloane; but he was of Avonlea, so no outsider had any business to laugh at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Charlie and Gilbert have always been friends,&rdquo; she said coldly. &ldquo;Charlie is a nice boy. He&rsquo;s not to blame for his eyes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me that! He is! He must have done something dreadful in a previous existence to be punished with such eyes. Pris and I are going to have such sport with him this afternoon. We&rsquo;ll make fun of him to his face and he&rsquo;ll never know it.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
