<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>There is a book of Revelation in every one&rsquo;s life, as there is in the Bible. Anne read hers that bitter night, as she kept her agonized vigil through the hours of storm and darkness. She loved Gilbert&mdash;had always loved him! She knew that now. She knew that she could no more cast him out of her life without agony than she could have cut off her right hand and cast it from her. And the knowledge had come too late&mdash;too late even for the bitter solace of being with him at the last. If she had not been so blind&mdash;so foolish&mdash;she would have had the right to go to him now. But he would never know that she loved him&mdash;he would go away from this life thinking that she did not care.</p></div> </div>
