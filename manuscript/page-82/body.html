No doubt it is rather dreadful to feel insignificant; but I think it&rsquo;s better than to feel as big and awkward as I did&mdash;as if I were sprawled all over Redmond. That&rsquo;s how I felt&mdash;I suppose because I was a good two inches taller than any one else in the crowd. I wasn&rsquo;t afraid a Soph might walk over me; I was afraid they&rsquo;d take me for an elephant, or an overgrown sample of a potato-fed Islander.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I suppose the trouble is we can&rsquo;t forgive big Redmond for not being little Queen&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Anne, gathering about her the shreds of her old cheerful philosophy to cover her nakedness of spirit.</p></div> </div>
