<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;A very good epitaph,&rdquo; commented Anne thoughtfully. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t wish a better. We are all servants of some sort, and if the fact that we are faithful can be truthfully inscribed on our tombstones nothing more need be added. Here&rsquo;s a sorrowful little gray stone, Prissy&mdash;&lsquo;to the memory of a favorite child.&rsquo; And here is another &lsquo;erected to the memory of one who is buried elsewhere.&rsquo; I wonder where that unknown grave is. Really, Pris, the graveyards of today will never be as interesting as this. You were right&mdash;I shall come here often. I love it already. I see we&rsquo;re not alone here&mdash;there&rsquo;s a girl down at the end of this avenue.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
