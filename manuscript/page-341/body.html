<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;THE ROLLINGS RELIABLE</p><p>&ldquo;BAKING POWDER Co.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; said Anne, blankly.</p><p>Diana clapped her hands.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I KNEW it would win the prize&mdash;I was sure of it. I sent your story into the competition, Anne.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Diana&mdash;Barry!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I did,&rdquo; said Diana gleefully, perching herself on the bed. &ldquo;When I saw the offer I thought of your story in a minute, and at first I thought I&rsquo;d ask you to send it in. But then I was afraid you wouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;you had so little faith left in it. So I just decided I&rsquo;d send the copy you gave me, and say nothing about it. Then, if it didn&rsquo;t win the prize, you&rsquo;d never know and you wouldn&rsquo;t feel badly over it, because the stories that failed were not to be returned, and if it did you&rsquo;d have such a delightful surprise.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
