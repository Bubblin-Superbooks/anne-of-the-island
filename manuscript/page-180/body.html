<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Would you like him for a husband?&rdquo; asked Jane calmly.</p><p>&ldquo;A husband!&rdquo; Anne had been sitting up in bed, the better to wrestle with the problem of her exact opinion of Billy Andrews. Now she fell flatly back on her pillows, the very breath gone out of her. &ldquo;Whose husband?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yours, of course,&rdquo; answered Jane. &ldquo;Billy wants to marry you. He&rsquo;s always been crazy about you&mdash;and now father has given him the upper farm in his own name and there&rsquo;s nothing to prevent him from getting married. But he&rsquo;s so shy he couldn&rsquo;t ask you himself if you&rsquo;d have him, so he got me to do it. I&rsquo;d rather not have, but he gave me no peace till I said I would, if I got a good chance. What do you think about it, Anne?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
