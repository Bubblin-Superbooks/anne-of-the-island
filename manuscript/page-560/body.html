Valley Road is noted for its good-looking schoolma&rsquo;ams, just as Millersville is noted for its humly ones. Janet Sweet asked me this morning if I could bring you out. I said, &lsquo;Sartin I kin, if she don&rsquo;t mind being scrunched up some. This rig of mine&rsquo;s kinder small for the mail bags and I&rsquo;m some heftier than Thomas!&rsquo; Just wait, miss, till I shift these bags a bit and I&rsquo;ll tuck you in somehow. It&rsquo;s only two miles to Janet&rsquo;s. Her next-door neighbor&rsquo;s hired boy is coming for your trunk tonight. My name is Skinner&mdash;Amelia Skinner.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
