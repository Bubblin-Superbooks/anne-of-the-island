<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;What had your mother against me?&rdquo; cried Janet.</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing&mdash;nothing. She just didn&rsquo;t want another woman&mdash;ANY woman&mdash;there while she was living. She said if I didn&rsquo;t promise she&rsquo;d die right there and I&rsquo;d have killed her. So I promised. And she&rsquo;s held me to that promise ever since, though I&rsquo;ve gone on my knees to her in my turn to beg her to let me off.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me this?&rdquo; asked Janet chokingly. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;d only KNOWN! Why didn&rsquo;t you just tell me?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
