It&rsquo;s a hard lesson for cats and humans to learn.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to part with Rusty,&rdquo; said Anne regretfully, &ldquo;but it would be no use to take him to Green Gables. Marilla detests cats, and Davy would tease his life out. Besides, I don&rsquo;t suppose I&rsquo;ll be home very long. I&rsquo;ve been offered the principalship of the Summerside High School.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
