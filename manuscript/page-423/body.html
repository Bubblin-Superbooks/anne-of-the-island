<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Yes, it has,&rdquo; owned Anne.</p><p>&ldquo;And you all love me&mdash;even Aunt Jamesina, who thinks I&rsquo;m stark mad. So why should I try to be different? Oh, dear, I&rsquo;m so sleepy. I was awake until one last night, reading a harrowing ghost story. I read it in bed, and after I had finished it do you suppose I could get out of bed to put the light out? No! And if Stella had not fortunately come in late that lamp would have burned good and bright till morning. When I heard Stella I called her in, explained my predicament, and got her to put out the light. If I had got out myself to do it I knew something would grab me by the feet when I was getting in again. By the way, Anne, has Aunt Jamesina decided what to do this summer?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
