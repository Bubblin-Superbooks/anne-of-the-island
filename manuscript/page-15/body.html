And you and Gilbert gone&mdash;it will be awfully dull.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fred will be here,&rdquo; insinuated Anne slyly.</p><p>&ldquo;When is Mrs. Lynde going to move up?&rdquo; asked Diana, as if she had not heard Anne&rsquo;s remark.</p><p>&ldquo;Tomorrow. I&rsquo;m glad she&rsquo;s coming&mdash;but it will be another change. Marilla and I cleared everything out of the spare room yesterday. Do you know, I hated to do it? Of course, it was silly&mdash;but it did seem as if we were committing sacrilege. That old spare room has always seemed like a shrine to me. When I was a child I thought it the most wonderful apartment in the world.</p></div> </div>
