Church is awful dull. Anyway, I don&rsquo;t mean to go for ever so long. I mean to live to be a hundred years old, like Mr. Thomas Blewett of White Sands. He says he&rsquo;s lived so long &lsquo;cause he always smoked tobacco and it killed all the germs. Can I smoke tobacco pretty soon, Anne?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, Davy, I hope you&rsquo;ll never use tobacco,&rdquo; said Anne absently.</p></div> </div>
