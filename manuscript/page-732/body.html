But she made answer lightly.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course. Everybody has. It wouldn&rsquo;t do for us to have all our dreams fulfilled. We would be as good as dead if we had nothing left to dream about. What a delicious aroma that low-descending sun is extracting from the asters and ferns. I wish we could see perfumes as well as smell them. I&rsquo;m sure they would be very beautiful.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
