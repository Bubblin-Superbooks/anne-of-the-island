<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Green Gables was wrapped in darkness and silence when Anne reached home. She lost no time going to bed, for she was very tired and sleepy. There had been several Avonlea jollifications the preceding week, involving rather late hours. Anne&rsquo;s head was hardly on her pillow before she was half asleep; but just then her door was softly opened and a pleading voice said, &ldquo;Anne.&rdquo;</p><p>Anne sat up drowsily.</p><p>&ldquo;Davy, is that you? What is the matter?&rdquo;</p><p>A white-clad figure flung itself across the floor and on to the bed.</p><p>&ldquo;Anne,&rdquo; sobbed Davy, getting his arms about her neck. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m awful glad you&rsquo;re home. I couldn&rsquo;t go to sleep till I&rsquo;d told somebody.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
