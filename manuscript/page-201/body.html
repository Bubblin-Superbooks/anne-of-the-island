<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I always call her Aunt Jimsie. Well, her only daughter has recently married and gone to the foreign mission field. Aunt Jamesina is left alone in a great big house, and she is horribly lonesome. She will come to Kingsport and keep house for us if we want her, and I know you&rsquo;ll both love her. The more I think of the plan the more I like it. We could have such good, independent times.</p><p>&ldquo;Now, if you and Priscilla agree to it, wouldn&rsquo;t it be a good idea for you, who are on the spot, to look around and see if you can find a suitable house this spring? That would be better than leaving it till the fall. If you could get a furnished one so much the better, but if not, we can scare up a few sticks of finiture between us and old family friends with attics.</p></div> </div>
