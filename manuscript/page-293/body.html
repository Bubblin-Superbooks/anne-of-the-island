But at least she wore dresses.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve come to go fishing,&rdquo; announced Davy.</p><p>&ldquo;Whoop,&rdquo; yelled the Cottons. They rushed away to dig worms at once, Mirabel leading the van with a tin can. Dora could have sat down and cried. Oh, if only that hateful Frank Bell had never kissed her! Then she could have defied Davy, and gone to her beloved Sunday School.</p><p>They dared not, of course, go fishing on the pond, where they would be seen by people going to church. They had to resort to the brook in the woods behind the Cotton house. But it was full of trout, and they had a glorious time that morning&mdash;at least the Cottons certainly had, and Davy seemed to have it.</p></div> </div>
