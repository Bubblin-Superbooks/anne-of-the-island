I wish old Aunt Atossa&rsquo;s funeral was tomorrow instead of today. I wanted to go to it &lsquo;cause Milty said his mother said Aunt Atossa would be sure to rise up in her coffin and say sarcastic things to the folks that come to see her buried. But Marilla said she didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Poor Atossa laid in her coffin peaceful enough,&rdquo; said Mrs. Lynde solemnly. &ldquo;I never saw her look so pleasant before, that&rsquo;s what. Well, there weren&rsquo;t many tears shed over her, poor old soul. The Elisha Wrights are thankful to be rid of her, and I can&rsquo;t say I blame them a mite.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
