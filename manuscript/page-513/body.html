Why don&rsquo;t you stay down where you belong?&rdquo;</p><p>Anne picked up her orchids and went downstairs, where Aunt Jamesina was presiding over a row of coats hung before the fire to warm. Roy Gardner was waiting for Anne and teasing the Sarah-cat while he waited. The Sarah-cat did not approve of him. She always turned her back on him. But everybody else at Patty&rsquo;s Place liked him very much. Aunt Jamesina, carried away by his unfailing and deferential courtesy, and the pleading tones of his delightful voice, declared he was the nicest young man she ever knew, and that Anne was a very fortunate girl. Such remarks made Anne restive. Roy&rsquo;s wooing had certainly been as romantic as girlish heart could desire, but&mdash;she wished Aunt Jamesina and the girls would not take things so for granted.</p></div> </div>
