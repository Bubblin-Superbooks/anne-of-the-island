It was real romantic.&rdquo; Anne tried to picture Mrs. Skinner on speaking terms with romance and failed.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; she said again.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. Y&rsquo;see, there was another man after me. Jog along, black mare. I&rsquo;d been a widder so long folks had given up expecting me to marry again.
