<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Janet came home in the twilight.</p><p>&ldquo;Mrs. Douglas is dead,&rdquo; she said wearily. &ldquo;She died soon after I got there. She just spoke to me once&mdash;&lsquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ll marry John now?&rsquo; she said. It cut me to the heart, Anne. To think John&rsquo;s own mother thought I wouldn&rsquo;t marry him because of her! I couldn&rsquo;t say a word either&mdash;there were other women there. I was thankful John had gone out.&rdquo;</p><p>Janet began to cry drearily. But Anne brewed her a hot drink of ginger tea to her comforting. To be sure, Anne discovered later on that she had used white pepper instead of ginger; but Janet never knew the difference.</p></div> </div>
