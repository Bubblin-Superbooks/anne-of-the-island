He was a very lank, very ragged, very homely youth. But in her sight he was as beautiful as those who bring good tidings on the mountains. Never, as long as she lived, would Anne see Pacifique&rsquo;s brown, round, black-eyed face without a warm remembrance of the moment when he had given to her the oil of joy for mourning.</p><p>Long after Pacifique&rsquo;s gay whistle had faded into the phantom of music and then into silence far up under the maples of Lover&rsquo;s Lane Anne stood under the willows, tasting the poignant sweetness of life when some great dread has been removed from it. The morning was a cup filled with mist and glamor. In the corner near her was a rich surprise of new-blown, crystal-dewed roses.</p></div> </div>
