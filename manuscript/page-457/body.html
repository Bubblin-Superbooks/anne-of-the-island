<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Echo is a beautiful nymph, Davy, living far away in the woods, and laughing at the world from among the hills.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What does she look like?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Her hair and eyes are dark, but her neck and arms are white as snow. No mortal can ever see how fair she is. She is fleeter than a deer, and that mocking voice of hers is all we can know of her. You can hear her calling at night; you can hear her laughing under the stars. But you can never see her. She flies afar if you follow her, and laughs at you always just over the next hill.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
