<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Ruby raised herself on her arm and lifted up her bright, beautiful blue eyes to the moonlit skies.</p><p>&ldquo;I want to live,&rdquo; she said, in a trembling voice. &ldquo;I want to live like other girls. I&mdash;I want to be married, Anne&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;have little children. You know I always loved babies, Anne. I couldn&rsquo;t say this to any one but you. I know you understand. And then poor Herb&mdash;he&mdash;he loves me and I love him, Anne. The others meant nothing to me, but HE does&mdash;and if I could live I would be his wife and be so happy. Oh, Anne, it&rsquo;s hard.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
