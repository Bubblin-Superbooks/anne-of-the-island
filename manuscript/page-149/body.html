She lives there with her niece, and they&rsquo;ve lived there for hundreds of years, more or less&mdash;maybe a little less, Anne. Exaggeration is merely a flight of poetic fancy. I understand that wealthy folk have tried to buy the lot time and again&mdash;it&rsquo;s really worth a small fortune now, you know&mdash;but &lsquo;Patty&rsquo; won&rsquo;t sell upon any consideration. And there&rsquo;s an apple orchard behind the house in place of a back yard&mdash;you&rsquo;ll see it when we get a little past&mdash;a real apple orchard on Spofford Avenue!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
