I suppose we have been unconsciously expecting to take life up at Redmond just where we left off at Queen&rsquo;s, and now we feel as if the ground had slipped from under our feet. I&rsquo;m thankful that neither Mrs. Lynde nor Mrs. Elisha Wright know, or ever will know, my state of mind at present. They would exult in saying &lsquo;I told you so,&rsquo; and be convinced it was the beginning of the end. Whereas it is just the end of the beginning.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Exactly. That sounds more Anneish. In a little while we&rsquo;ll be acclimated and acquainted, and all will be well. Anne, did you notice the girl who stood alone just outside the door of the coeds&rsquo; dressing room all the morning&mdash;the pretty one with the brown eyes and crooked mouth?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
