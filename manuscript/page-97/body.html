<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> And I&rsquo;ll be just as obliging to you if you want me to&mdash;I CAN be, with a clear conscience.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; laughed Anne, &ldquo;but Priscilla and I are so firmly convinced of our own good looks that we don&rsquo;t need any assurance about them, so you needn&rsquo;t trouble.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re laughing at me. I know you think I&rsquo;m abominably vain, but I&rsquo;m not. There really isn&rsquo;t one spark of vanity in me. And I&rsquo;m never a bit grudging about paying compliments to other girls when they deserve them. I&rsquo;m so glad I know you folks. I came up on Saturday and I&rsquo;ve nearly died of homesickness ever since.</p></div> </div>
