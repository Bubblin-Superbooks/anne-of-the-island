<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;The fifth old lady is Mrs. Grant. She is a sweet old thing; but she never says anything but good of anybody and so she is a very uninteresting conversationalist.</p><p>&ldquo;And now for Jonas, Anne.</p><p>&ldquo;That first day I came I saw a young man sitting opposite me at the table, smiling at me as if he had known me from my cradle. I knew, for Uncle Mark had told me, that his name was Jonas Blake, that he was a Theological Student from St. Columbia, and that he had taken charge of the Point Prospect Mission Church for the summer.</p><p>&ldquo;He is a very ugly young man&mdash;really, the ugliest young man I&rsquo;ve ever seen. He has a big, loose-jointed figure with absurdly long legs. His hair is tow-color and lank, his eyes are green, and his mouth is big, and his ears&mdash;but I never think about his ears if I can help it.</p></div> </div>
