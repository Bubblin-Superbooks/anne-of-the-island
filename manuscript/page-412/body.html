There isn&rsquo;t a particle of envy in you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why should she be envious?&rdquo; demanded Aunt Jamesina. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s not quite as goodlooking as you, maybe, but she&rsquo;s got a far handsomer nose.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; conceded Phil.</p><p>&ldquo;My nose always has been a great comfort to me,&rdquo; confessed Anne.</p><p>&ldquo;And I love the way your hair grows on your forehead, Anne. And that one wee curl, always looking as if it were going to drop, but never dropping, is delicious. But as for noses, mine is a dreadful worry to me. I know by the time I&rsquo;m forty it will be Byrney. What do you think I&rsquo;ll look like when I&rsquo;m forty, Anne?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
