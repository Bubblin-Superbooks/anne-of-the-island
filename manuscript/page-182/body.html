But you might think it over, Anne. Billy is a good fellow. I must say that, if he is my brother. He has no bad habits and he&rsquo;s a great worker, and you can depend on him. &lsquo;A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.&rsquo; He told me to tell you he&rsquo;d be quite willing to wait till you got through college, if you insisted, though he&rsquo;d RATHER get married this spring before the planting begins. He&rsquo;d always be very good to you, I&rsquo;m sure, and you know, Anne, I&rsquo;d love to have you for a sister.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
