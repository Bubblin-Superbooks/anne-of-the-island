<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Miss Ada&rsquo;s cushions are really getting on my nerves,&rdquo; said Anne. &ldquo;She finished two new ones last week, stuffed and embroidered within an inch of their lives. There being absolutely no other cushionless place to put them she stood them up against the wall on the stair landing. They topple over half the time and if we come up or down the stairs in the dark we fall over them. Last Sunday, when Dr. Davis prayed for all those exposed to the perils of the sea, I added in thought &lsquo;and for all those who live in houses where cushions are loved not wisely but too well!&rsquo; There! we&rsquo;re ready, and I see the boys coming through Old St. John&rsquo;s. Do you cast in your lot with us, Phil?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
