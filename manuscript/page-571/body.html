<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I like her; and she likes me&mdash;principally, it seems, because she had a sister named Anne who died young.</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m real glad to see you,&rsquo; she said briskly, when I landed in her yard. &lsquo;My, you don&rsquo;t look a mite like I expected. I was sure you&rsquo;d be dark&mdash;my sister Anne was dark. And here you&rsquo;re redheaded!&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For a few minutes I thought I wasn&rsquo;t going to like Janet as much as I had expected at first sight. Then I reminded myself that I really must be more sensible than to be prejudiced against any one simply because she called my hair red. Probably the word &lsquo;auburn&rsquo; was not in Janet&rsquo;s vocabulary at all.</p></div> </div>
