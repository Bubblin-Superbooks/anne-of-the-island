<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> You know, when Christmas is a dirty grayey-browney affair, looking as if it had been left over a hundred years ago and had been in soak ever since, it is called a GREEN Christmas! Don&rsquo;t ask me why. As Lord Dundreary says, &lsquo;there are thome thingth no fellow can underthtand.&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Anne, did you ever get on a street car and then discover that you hadn&rsquo;t any money with you to pay your fare? I did, the other day. It&rsquo;s quite awful. I had a nickel with me when I got on the car. I thought it was in the left pocket of my coat. When I got settled down comfortably I felt for it. It wasn&rsquo;t there. I had a cold chill. I felt in the other pocket. Not there. I had another chill. Then I felt in a little inside pocket. All in vain. I had two chills at once.</p></div> </div>
