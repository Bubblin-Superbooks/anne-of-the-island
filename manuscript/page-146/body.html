Nobody can build on it unless he&rsquo;s a millionaire.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, do,&rdquo; said Phil. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a perfectly killing little place I want to show you, Anne. IT wasn&rsquo;t built by a millionaire. It&rsquo;s the first place after you leave the park, and must have grown while Spofford Avenue was still a country road. It DID grow&mdash;it wasn&rsquo;t built! I don&rsquo;t care for the houses on the Avenue. They&rsquo;re too brand new and plateglassy. But this little spot is a dream&mdash;and its name&mdash;but wait till you see it.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
