<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Miss Lavendar wants me to go through to Echo Lodge some day while I&rsquo;m home and light a fire to air it, and see that the cushions aren&rsquo;t getting moldy. I think I&rsquo;ll get Diana to go over with me next week, and we can spend the evening with Theodora Dix. I want to see Theodora. By the way, is Ludovic Speed still going to see her?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They say so,&rdquo; said Marilla, &ldquo;and he&rsquo;s likely to continue it. Folks have given up expecting that that courtship will ever arrive anywhere.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d hurry him up a bit, if I was Theodora, that&rsquo;s what,&rdquo; said Mrs. Lynde. And there is not the slightest doubt but that she would.</p></div> </div>
