It&rsquo;s one of my few&mdash;sadly few&mdash;useful accomplishments. I&rsquo;ve disposed of several at home. You take the cat in the morning and give him a good breakfast. Then you take an old burlap bag&mdash;there&rsquo;s one in the back porch&mdash;put the cat on it and turn over him a wooden box. Then take a two-ounce bottle of chloroform, uncork it, and slip it under the edge of the box. Put a heavy weight on top of the box and leave it till evening. The cat will be dead, curled up peacefully as if he were asleep. No pain&mdash;no struggle.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
