<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Well, can you go tomorrow afternoon, then?&rdquo; asked Gilbert, apparently not much disappointed.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I think so.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In that case I shall hie me home at once to do something I should otherwise have to do tomorrow. So Alice Penhallow is to be married tonight. Three weddings for you in one summer, Anne&mdash;Phil&rsquo;s, Alice&rsquo;s, and Jane&rsquo;s. I&rsquo;ll never forgive Jane for not inviting me to her wedding.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You really can&rsquo;t blame her when you think of the tremendous Andrews connection who had to be invited. The house could hardly hold them all. I was only bidden by grace of being Jane&rsquo;s old chum&mdash;at least on Jane&rsquo;s part. I think Mrs. Harmon&rsquo;s motive for inviting me was to let me see Jane&rsquo;s surpassing gorgeousness.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
