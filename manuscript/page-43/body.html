I&rsquo;m tired because I&rsquo;ve been packing my trunk and sewing all day. But I&rsquo;m disgruntled because six women have been here to say good-bye to me, and every one of the six managed to say something that seemed to take the color right out of life and leave it as gray and dismal and cheerless as a November morning.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Spiteful old cats!&rdquo; was Gilbert&rsquo;s elegant comment.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, no, they weren&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Anne seriously. &ldquo;That is just the trouble. If they had been spiteful cats I wouldn&rsquo;t have minded them. But they are all nice, kind, motherly souls, who like me and whom I like, and that is why what they said, or hinted, had such undue weight with me.</p></div> </div>
