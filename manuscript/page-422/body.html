Am I not up against them now? You don&rsquo;t call Alec and Alonzo pleasant things, do you, when they simply plague my life out?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You never take anything seriously, Phil.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why should I? There are enough folks who do. The world needs people like me, Anne, just to amuse it. It would be a terrible place if EVERYBODY were intellectual and serious and in deep, deadly earnest. MY mission is, as Josiah Allen says, &lsquo;to charm and allure.&rsquo; Confess now. Hasn&rsquo;t life at Patty&rsquo;s Place been really much brighter and pleasanter this past winter because I&rsquo;ve been here to leaven you?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
