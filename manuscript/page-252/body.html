Well, they used to have a prayer meeting on Sunday evenings, and all the church members present would get up and pray in turn, or say a few words on some Bible verse. But one evening Aunt Atossa bounced up. She didn&rsquo;t either pray or preach. Instead, she lit into everybody else in the church and gave them a fearful raking down, calling them right out by name and telling them how they all had behaved, and casting up all the quarrels and scandals of the past ten years. Finally she wound up by saying that she was disgusted with Spencervale church and she never meant to darken its door again, and she hoped a fearful judgment would come upon it. Then she sat down out of breath, and the minister, who hadn&rsquo;t heard a word she said, immediately remarked, in a very devout voice, &lsquo;amen! The Lord grant our dear sister&rsquo;s prayer!&rsquo; You ought to hear father tell the story.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
