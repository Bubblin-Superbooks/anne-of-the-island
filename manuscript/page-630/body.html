<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Anne sat on the floor in a little circle of light cast by the lamp beside her, amid a surrounding snow of crumpled manuscript.</p><p>&ldquo;What in the world are you doing?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just looking over some old Story Club yarns. I wanted something to cheer AND inebriate. I&rsquo;d studied until the world seemed azure. So I came up here and dug these out of my trunk. They are so drenched in tears and tragedy that they are excruciatingly funny.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m blue and discouraged myself,&rdquo; said Stella, throwing herself on the couch. &ldquo;Nothing seems worthwhile. My very thoughts are old. I&rsquo;ve thought them all before. What is the use of living after all, Anne?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
