<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I&rsquo;ve fought so hard to live&mdash;and it isn&rsquo;t any use&mdash;I have to die&mdash;and leave EVERYTHING I care for.&rdquo; Anne sat in a pain that was almost intolerable. She could not tell comforting falsehoods; and all that Ruby said was so horribly true. She WAS leaving everything she cared for. She had laid up her treasures on earth only; she had lived solely for the little things of life&mdash;the things that pass&mdash;forgetting the great things that go onward into eternity, bridging the gulf between the two lives and making of death a mere passing from one dwelling to the other&mdash;from twilight to unclouded day. God would take care of her there&mdash;Anne believed&mdash;she would learn&mdash;but now it was no wonder her soul clung, in blind helplessness, to the only things she knew and loved.</p></div> </div>
