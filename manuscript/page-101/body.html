<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Why must you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Honey, you couldn&rsquo;t imagine ME being a poor man&rsquo;s wife, could you? I can&rsquo;t do a single useful thing, and I am VERY extravagant. Oh, no, my husband must have heaps of money. So that narrowed them down to two. But I couldn&rsquo;t decide between two any easier than between two hundred. I knew perfectly well that whichever one I chose I&rsquo;d regret all my life that I hadn&rsquo;t married the other.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you&mdash;love&mdash;either of them?&rdquo; asked Anne, a little hesitatingly. It was not easy for her to speak to a stranger of the great mystery and transformation of life.</p></div> </div>
