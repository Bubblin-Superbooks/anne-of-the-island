<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I think, perhaps, we have very mistaken ideas about heaven&mdash;what it is and what it holds for us. I don&rsquo;t think it can be so very different from life here as most people seem to think. I believe we&rsquo;ll just go on living, a good deal as we live here&mdash;and be OURSELVES just the same&mdash;only it will be easier to be good and to&mdash;follow the highest. All the hindrances and perplexities will be taken away, and we shall see clearly. Don&rsquo;t be afraid, Ruby.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; said Ruby pitifully. &ldquo;Even if what you say about heaven is true&mdash;and you can&rsquo;t be sure&mdash;it may be only that imagination of yours&mdash;it won&rsquo;t be JUST the same. It CAN&rsquo;T be. I want to go on living HERE. I&rsquo;m so young, Anne. I haven&rsquo;t had my life.</p></div> </div>
