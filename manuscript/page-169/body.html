Some one will have to. When I saw Alec my heart gave a great thump and I thought, &lsquo;He might be the right one.&rsquo; And then, when Alonzo came, thump went my heart again. So that&rsquo;s no guide, though it should be, according to all the novels I&rsquo;ve ever read. Now, Anne, YOUR heart wouldn&rsquo;t thump for anybody but the genuine Prince Charming, would it? There must be something radically wrong with mine. But I&rsquo;m having a perfectly gorgeous time. How I wish you were here! It&rsquo;s snowing today, and I&rsquo;m rapturous. I was so afraid we&rsquo;d have a green Christmas and I loathe them.</p></div> </div>
