<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I forgot to tell you what happened the day the minister called here. It was the funniest thing I ever saw. I said to Marilla, &lsquo;If Anne had been here wouldn&rsquo;t she have had a laugh?&rsquo; Even Marilla laughed. You know he&rsquo;s a very short, fat little man with bow legs. Well, that old pig of Mr. Harrison&rsquo;s&mdash;the big, tall one&mdash;had wandered over here that day again and broke into the yard, and it got into the back porch, unbeknowns to us, and it was there when the minister appeared in the doorway. It made one wild bolt to get out, but there was nowhere to bolt to except between them bow legs. So there it went, and, being as it was so big and the minister so little, it took him clean off his feet and carried him away. His hat went one way and his cane another, just as Marilla and I got to the door. I&rsquo;ll never forget the look of him.</p></div> </div>
