<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;We are not really parting, Anne,&rdquo; protested Diana. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going far away. We&rsquo;ll love each other just as much as ever. We&rsquo;ve always kept that &lsquo;oath&rsquo; of friendship we swore long ago, haven&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. We&rsquo;ve kept it faithfully. We&rsquo;ve had a beautiful friendship, Diana. We&rsquo;ve never marred it by one quarrel or coolness or unkind word; and I hope it will always be so. But things can&rsquo;t be quite the same after this. You&rsquo;ll have other interests. I&rsquo;ll just be on the outside. But &lsquo;such is life&rsquo; as Mrs. Rachel says. Mrs. Rachel has given you one of her beloved knitted quilts of the &lsquo;tobacco stripe&rsquo; pattern, and she says when I am married she&rsquo;ll give me one, too.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
