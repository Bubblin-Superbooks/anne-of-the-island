<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Your room is a front one and looks out on Old St. John&rsquo;s graveyard, which is just across the street.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That sounds gruesome,&rdquo; shivered Anne. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;d rather have the back yard view.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, no, you wouldn&rsquo;t. Wait and see. Old St. John&rsquo;s is a darling place. It&rsquo;s been a graveyard so long that it&rsquo;s ceased to be one and has become one of the sights of Kingsport. I was all through it yesterday for a pleasure exertion. There&rsquo;s a big stone wall and a row of enormous trees all around it, and rows of trees all through it, and the queerest old tombstones, with the queerest and quaintest inscriptions. You&rsquo;ll go there to study, Anne, see if you don&rsquo;t. Of course, nobody is ever buried there now.</p></div> </div>
