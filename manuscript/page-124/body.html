Things have come to a pretty pass if a minister can&rsquo;t find enough in Holy Writ to preach about, that&rsquo;s what. What church do you attend, Anne? I hope you go regularly. People are apt to get so careless about church-going away from home, and I understand college students are great sinners in this respect. I&rsquo;m told many of them actually study their lessons on Sunday. I hope you&rsquo;ll never sink that low, Anne. Remember how you were brought up. And be very careful what friends you make. You never know what sort of creatures are in them colleges. Outwardly they may be as whited sepulchers and inwardly as ravening wolves, that&rsquo;s what. You&rsquo;d better not have anything to say to any young man who isn&rsquo;t from the Island.</p></div> </div>
