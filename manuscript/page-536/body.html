<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk like that about your teacher, Davy Keith,&rdquo; said Mrs. Rachel severely. &ldquo;Miss Carson is a very fine girl. There is no nonsense about her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t sound very attractive,&rdquo; laughed Anne. &ldquo;I like people to have a little nonsense about them. But I&rsquo;m inclined to have a better opinion of Miss Carson than you have. I saw her in prayer-meeting last night, and she has a pair of eyes that can&rsquo;t always look sensible. Now, Davy-boy, take heart of grace. &lsquo;Tomorrow will bring another day&rsquo; and I&rsquo;ll help you with the sums as far as in me lies. Don&rsquo;t waste this lovely hour &lsquo;twixt light and dark worrying over arithmetic.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
