Priscilla&rsquo;s gay chatter had the intended effect of cheering her up; homesickness vanished for the time being, and did not even return in full force when she finally found herself alone in her little bedroom. She went to her window and looked out. The street below was dim and quiet. Across it the moon was shining above the trees in Old St. John&rsquo;s, just behind the great dark head of the lion on the monument. Anne wondered if it could have been only that morning that she had left Green Gables. She had the sense of a long passage of time which one day of change and travel gives.</p><p>&ldquo;I suppose that very moon is looking down on Green Gables now,&rdquo; she mused. &ldquo;But I won&rsquo;t think about it&mdash;that way homesickness lies. I&rsquo;m not even going to have my good cry.</p></div> </div>
