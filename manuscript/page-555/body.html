<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Are you going to be in Avonlea all summer?&rdquo; asked Gilbert.</p><p>&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m going down east to Valley Road next week. Esther Haythorne wants me to teach for her through July and August. They have a summer term in that school, and Esther isn&rsquo;t feeling well. So I&rsquo;m going to substitute for her. In one way I don&rsquo;t mind. Do you know, I&rsquo;m beginning to feel a little bit like a stranger in Avonlea now? It makes me sorry&mdash;but it&rsquo;s true. It&rsquo;s quite appalling to see the number of children who have shot up into big boys and girls&mdash;really young men and women&mdash;these past two years. Half of my pupils are grown up. It makes me feel awfully old to see them in the places you and I and our mates used to fill.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
