Instead, she was a tiny scrap of a woman, with soft pink cheeks, mild blue eyes, and a mouth like a baby&rsquo;s. Dressed in a beautiful, fashionably-made black silk dress, with a fluffy white shawl over her shoulders, and her snowy hair surmounted by a dainty lace cap, she might have posed as a grandmother doll.</p><p>&ldquo;How do you do, Janet dear?&rdquo; she said sweetly. &ldquo;I am so glad to see you again, dear.&rdquo; She put up her pretty old face to be kissed. &ldquo;And this is our new teacher. I&rsquo;m delighted to meet you. My son has been singing your praises until I&rsquo;m half jealous, and I&rsquo;m sure Janet ought to be wholly so.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
