<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t give up altogether,&rdquo; said Mr. Harrison reflectively. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d write a story once in a while, but I wouldn&rsquo;t pester editors with it. I&rsquo;d write of people and places like I knew, and I&rsquo;d make my characters talk everyday English; and I&rsquo;d let the sun rise and set in the usual quiet way without much fuss over the fact. If I had to have villains at all, I&rsquo;d give them a chance, Anne&mdash;I&rsquo;d give them a chance. There are some terrible bad men in the world, I suppose, but you&rsquo;d have to go a long piece to find them&mdash;though Mrs. Lynde believes we&rsquo;re all bad. But most of us have got a little decency somewhere in us. Keep on writing, Anne.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
