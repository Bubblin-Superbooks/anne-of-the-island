I think we have, Aunty,&rdquo; protested Anne.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve learned the truth of what Professor Woodleigh told us last Philomathic,&rdquo; said Phil. &ldquo;He said, &lsquo;Humor is the spiciest condiment in the feast of existence. Laugh at your mistakes but learn from them, joke over your troubles but gather strength from them, make a jest of your difficulties but overcome them.&rsquo; Isn&rsquo;t that worth learning, Aunt Jimsie?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
