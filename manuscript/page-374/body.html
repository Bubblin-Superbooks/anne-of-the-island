After they had been released and fed, Joseph selected the cushion and corner which appealed to him, and the Sarah-cat gravely sat herself down before the fire and proceeded to wash her face. She was a large, sleek, gray-and-white cat, with an enormous dignity which was not at all impaired by any consciousness of her plebian origin. She had been given to Aunt Jamesina by her washerwoman.</p><p>&ldquo;Her name was Sarah, so my husband always called puss the Sarah-cat,&rdquo; explained Aunt Jamesina. &ldquo;She is eight years old, and a remarkable mouser. Don&rsquo;t worry, Stella. The Sarah-cat NEVER fights and Joseph rarely.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
