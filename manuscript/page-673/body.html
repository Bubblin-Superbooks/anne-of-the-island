<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> When you start traveling late in life you&rsquo;re apt to do too much of it because you know you haven&rsquo;t much time left, and it&rsquo;s a thing that grows on you. I&rsquo;m afraid Maria will never be contented again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I shall leave here my fancies and dreams to bless the next comer,&rdquo; said Anne, looking around the blue room wistfully&mdash;her pretty blue room where she had spent three such happy years. She had knelt at its window to pray and had bent from it to watch the sunset behind the pines. She had heard the autumn raindrops beating against it and had welcomed the spring robins at its sill. She wondered if old dreams could haunt rooms&mdash;if, when one left forever the room where she had joyed and suffered and laughed and wept, something of her, intangible and invisible, yet nonetheless real, did not remain behind like a voiceful memory.</p></div> </div>
