I&rsquo;m a church member. But&mdash;it&rsquo;ll be all so different. I think&mdash;and think&mdash;and I get so frightened&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;homesick. Heaven must be very beautiful, of course, the Bible says so&mdash;but, Anne, IT WON&rsquo;T BE WHAT I&rsquo;VE BEEN USED TO.&rdquo;</p><p>Through Anne&rsquo;s mind drifted an intrusive recollection of a funny story she had heard Philippa Gordon tell&mdash;the story of some old man who had said very much the same thing about the world to come. It had sounded funny then&mdash;she remembered how she and Priscilla had laughed over it.</p></div> </div>
