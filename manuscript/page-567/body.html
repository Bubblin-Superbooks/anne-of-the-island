He always feels dretful tickled when I git a compliment. Jog along, black mare. Well, here we are. I hope you&rsquo;ll git on well in the school, miss. There&rsquo;s a short cut to it through the ma&rsquo;sh back of Janet&rsquo;s. If you take that way be awful keerful. If you once got stuck in that black mud you&rsquo;d be sucked right down and never seen or heard tell of again till the day of judgment, like Adam Palmer&rsquo;s cow. Jog along, black mare.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
