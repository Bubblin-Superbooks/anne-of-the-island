<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I can never forget the night I thought you were dying, Gilbert. Oh, I knew&mdash;I KNEW then&mdash;and I thought it was too late.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But it wasn&rsquo;t, sweetheart. Oh, Anne, this makes up for everything, doesn&rsquo;t it? Let&rsquo;s resolve to keep this day sacred to perfect beauty all our lives for the gift it has given us.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the birthday of our happiness,&rdquo; said Anne softly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always loved this old garden of Hester Gray&rsquo;s, and now it will be dearer than ever.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll have to ask you to wait a long time, Anne,&rdquo; said Gilbert sadly. &ldquo;It will be three years before I&rsquo;ll finish my medical course. And even then there will be no diamond sunbursts and marble halls.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
