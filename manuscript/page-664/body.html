<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Anne wondered why Gilbert should have sent her flowers for Convocation. She had seen very little of him during the past winter. He had come to Patty&rsquo;s Place only one Friday evening since the Christmas holidays, and they rarely met elsewhere. She knew he was studying very hard, aiming at High Honors and the Cooper Prize, and he took little part in the social doings of Redmond. Anne&rsquo;s own winter had been quite gay socially. She had seen a good deal of the Gardners; she and Dorothy were very intimate; college circles expected the announcement of her engagement to Roy any day. Anne expected it herself. Yet just before she left Patty&rsquo;s Place for Convocation she flung Roy&rsquo;s violets aside and put Gilbert&rsquo;s lilies-of-the-valley in their place. She could not have told why she did it.</p></div> </div>
