I had YOU, but she had no one.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think she felt pretty all-by-herselfish, too. Several times I saw her make a motion as if to cross over to us, but she never did it&mdash;too shy, I suppose. I wished she would come. If I hadn&rsquo;t felt so much like the aforesaid elephant I&rsquo;d have gone to her. But I couldn&rsquo;t lumber across that big hall with all those boys howling on the stairs.
