I told them they&rsquo;d have to wait till I could make up my mind. They&rsquo;re quite willing to wait. They both worship me, you know. Meanwhile, I intend to have a good time. I expect I shall have heaps of beaux at Redmond. I can&rsquo;t be happy unless I have, you know. But don&rsquo;t you think the freshmen are fearfully homely? I saw only one really handsome fellow among them. He went away before you came. I heard his chum call him Gilbert. His chum had eyes that stuck out THAT FAR. But you&rsquo;re not going yet, girls? Don&rsquo;t go yet.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
