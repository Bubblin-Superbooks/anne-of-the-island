But I&rsquo;m coming to Redmond.</p><p>&ldquo;And now, Anne, I&rsquo;ve a little plan. You know how I loathe boarding. I&rsquo;ve boarded for four years and I&rsquo;m so tired of it. I don&rsquo;t feel like enduring three years more of it.</p><p>&ldquo;Now, why can&rsquo;t you and Priscilla and I club together, rent a little house somewhere in Kingsport, and board ourselves?

She&rsquo;s the sweetest aunt that ever lived, in spite of her name. She can&rsquo;t help that! She was called Jamesina because her father, whose name was James, was drowned at sea a month before she was born.</p></div> </div>
