Shall I spend it here where there is a cosy fire, a plateful of delicious russets, three purring and harmonious cats, and two impeccable china dogs with green noses? Or shall I go to the park, where there is the lure of gray woods and of gray water lapping on the harbor rocks?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If I was as young as you, I&rsquo;d decide in favor of the park,&rdquo; said Aunt Jamesina, tickling Joseph&rsquo;s yellow ear with a knitting needle.</p></div> </div>
