<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad,&rdquo; said Anne dreamily. &ldquo;There are so many things I want to do. I want to sit on the back porch steps and feel the breeze blowing down over Mr. Harrison&rsquo;s fields. I want to hunt ferns in the Haunted Wood and gather violets in Violet Vale. Do you remember the day of our golden picnic, Priscilla? I want to hear the frogs singing and the poplars whispering. But I&rsquo;ve learned to love Kingsport, too, and I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m coming back next fall. If I hadn&rsquo;t won the Thorburn I don&rsquo;t believe I could have. I COULDN&rsquo;T take any of Marilla&rsquo;s little hoard.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
