But there was not a glint of humor on that lady&rsquo;s face. Evidently Mrs. Skinner saw nothing amusing in her own case.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d been a widder-man for three yers, and his sister kept house for him. Then she got married and he just wanted some one to look after his house. It was worth looking after, too, mind you that. It&rsquo;s a handsome house. Jog along, black mare. As for Thomas, he was poor, and if his house didn&rsquo;t leak in dry weather it was about all that could be said for it, though it looks kind of pictureaskew. But, y&rsquo;see, I loved Thomas, and I didn&rsquo;t care one red cent for W.O. So I argued it out with myself.</p></div> </div>
