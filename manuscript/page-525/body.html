<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;What about Alec and Alonzo?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I told them at Christmas that I never could marry either of them. It seems so funny now to remember that I ever thought it possible that I might. They felt so badly I just cried over both of them&mdash;howled. But I knew there was only one man in the world I could ever marry. I had made up my own mind for once and it was real easy, too. It&rsquo;s very delightful to feel so sure, and know it&rsquo;s your own sureness and not somebody else&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you suppose you&rsquo;ll be able to keep it up?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
