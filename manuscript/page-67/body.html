<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Here you are, beloved! And I suppose you&rsquo;re as tired as I was when I got here Saturday night.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tired! Priscilla, don&rsquo;t talk of it. I&rsquo;m tired, and green, and provincial, and only about ten years old. For pity&rsquo;s sake take your poor, broken-down chum to some place where she can hear herself think.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you right up to our boardinghouse. I&rsquo;ve a cab ready outside.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s such a blessing you&rsquo;re here, Prissy. If you weren&rsquo;t I think I should just sit down on my suitcase, here and now, and weep bitter tears. What a comfort one familiar face is in a howling wilderness of strangers!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
