<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> And that poor pig was near scared to death. I&rsquo;ll never be able to read that account in the Bible of the swine that rushed madly down the steep place into the sea without seeing Mr. Harrison&rsquo;s pig careering down the hill with that minister. I guess the pig thought he had the Old Boy on his back instead of inside of him. I was thankful the twins weren&rsquo;t about. It wouldn&rsquo;t have been the right thing for them to have seen a minister in such an undignified predicament. Just before they got to the brook the minister jumped off or fell off. The pig rushed through the brook like mad and up through the woods. Marilla and I run down and helped the minister get up and brush his coat. He wasn&rsquo;t hurt, but he was mad. He seemed to hold Marilla and me responsible for it all, though we told him the pig didn&rsquo;t belong to us, and had been pestering us all summer.</p></div> </div>
