My two college chums and I want to keep house next year instead of boarding, so we are looking for a little place to rent; and when I saw that this house was to let I was so happy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If you love it, you can have it,&rdquo; said Miss Patty. &ldquo;Maria and I decided today that we would not let it after all, because we did not like any of the people who have wanted it. We don&rsquo;t HAVE to let it. We can afford to go to Europe even if we don&rsquo;t let it.</p></div> </div>
