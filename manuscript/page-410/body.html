It just suits those brown tints of hers.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s magic in the words &lsquo;silk&rsquo; and &lsquo;lace,&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t there?&rdquo; said Aunt Jamesina. &ldquo;The very sound of them makes me feel like skipping off to a dance. And YELLOW silk. It makes one think of a dress of sunshine. I always wanted a yellow silk dress, but first my mother and then my husband wouldn&rsquo;t hear of it. The very first thing I&rsquo;m going to do when I get to heaven is to get a yellow silk dress.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
