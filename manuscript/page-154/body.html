There&rsquo;s to be no end of dances and drives and general jamborees. I shall never forgive you, Queen Anne, for not coming home with me for the holidays.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Never&rsquo; means three days with you, Phil. It was dear of you to ask me&mdash;and I&rsquo;d love to go to Bolingbroke some day. But I can&rsquo;t go this year&mdash;I MUST go home. You don&rsquo;t know how my heart longs for it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t have much of a time,&rdquo; said Phil scornfully. &ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be one or two quilting parties, I suppose; and all the old gossips will talk you over to your face and behind your back. You&rsquo;ll die of lonesomeness, child.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
