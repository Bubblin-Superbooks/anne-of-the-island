<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Anne had known beforehand of the party, but she had not known that she and Gilbert were, as the founders of the Society, to be presented with a very complimentary &ldquo;address&rdquo; and &ldquo;tokens of respect&rdquo;&mdash;in her case a volume of Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays, in Gilbert&rsquo;s a fountain pen. She was so taken by surprise and pleased by the nice things said in the address, read in Moody Spurgeon&rsquo;s most solemn and ministerial tones, that the tears quite drowned the sparkle of her big gray eyes. She had worked hard and faithfully for the A.V.I.S., and it warmed the cockles of her heart that the members appreciated her efforts so sincerely. And they were all so nice and friendly and jolly&mdash;even the Pye girls had their merits; at that moment Anne loved all the world.</p></div> </div>
