It was full of a proud young mother&rsquo;s accounts of &ldquo;baby&rdquo;&mdash;her cleverness, her brightness, her thousand sweetnesses.</p><p>&ldquo;I love her best when she is asleep and better still when she is awake,&rdquo; Bertha Shirley had written in the postscript. Probably it was the last sentence she had ever penned. The end was very near for her.</p><p>&ldquo;This has been the most beautiful day of my life,&rdquo; Anne said to Phil that night. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve FOUND my father and mother. Those letters have made them REAL to me. I&rsquo;m not an orphan any longer. I feel as if I had opened a book and found roses of yesterday, sweet and beloved, between its leaves.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
