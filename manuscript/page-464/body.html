Poor Anne could only blush horribly and murmur, &ldquo;not very lately,&rdquo; which was taken by all, Mrs. Blythe included, to be merely a maidenly evasion.</p><p>Apart from this, Anne enjoyed her summer. Priscilla came for a merry visit in June; and, when she had gone, Mr. and Mrs. Irving, Paul and Charlotta the Fourth came &ldquo;home&rdquo; for July and August.</p><p>Echo Lodge was the scene of gaieties once more, and the echoes over the river were kept busy mimicking the laughter that rang in the old garden behind the spruces.</p></div> </div>
