<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;People who haven&rsquo;t natural gumption never learn,&rdquo; retorted Aunt Jamesina, &ldquo;neither in college nor life. If they live to be a hundred they really don&rsquo;t know anything more than when they were born. It&rsquo;s their misfortune not their fault, poor souls. But those of us who have some gumption should duly thank the Lord for it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Will you please define what gumption is, Aunt Jimsie?&rdquo; asked Phil.</p><p>&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t, young woman. Any one who has gumption knows what it is, and any one who hasn&rsquo;t can never know what it is. So there is no need of defining it.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
