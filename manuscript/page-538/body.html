<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;It seems to me a most dreadful thing to go out of the world and not leave one person behind you who is sorry you are gone,&rdquo; said Anne, shuddering.</p><p>&ldquo;Nobody except her parents ever loved poor Atossa, that&rsquo;s certain, not even her husband,&rdquo; averred Mrs. Lynde. &ldquo;She was his fourth wife. He&rsquo;d sort of got into the habit of marrying. He only lived a few years after he married her. The doctor said he died of dyspepsia, but I shall always maintain that he died of Atossa&rsquo;s tongue, that&rsquo;s what. Poor soul, she always knew everything about her neighbors, but she never was very well acquainted with herself. Well, she&rsquo;s gone anyhow; and I suppose the next excitement will be Diana&rsquo;s wedding.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
