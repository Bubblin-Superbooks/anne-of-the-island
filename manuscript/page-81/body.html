At least, they&rsquo;d be familiar eyes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; sighed Anne. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t describe how I felt when I was standing there, waiting my turn to be registered&mdash;as insignificant as the teeniest drop in a most enormous bucket. It&rsquo;s bad enough to feel insignificant, but it&rsquo;s unbearable to have it grained into your soul that you will never, can never, be anything but insignificant, and that is how I did feel&mdash;as if I were invisible to the naked eye and some of those Sophs might step on me. I knew I would go down to my grave unwept, unhonored and unsung.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
