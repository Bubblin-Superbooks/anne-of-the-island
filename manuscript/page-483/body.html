<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Last Sunday Jonas preached in the village church. I went, of course, but I couldn&rsquo;t realize that Jonas was going to preach. The fact that he was a minister&mdash;or going to be one&mdash;persisted in seeming a huge joke to me.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, Jonas preached. And, by the time he had preached ten minutes, I felt so small and insignificant that I thought I must be invisible to the naked eye. Jonas never said a word about women and he never looked at me. But I realized then and there what a pitiful, frivolous, small-souled little butterfly I was, and how horribly different I must be from Jonas&rsquo; ideal woman. SHE would be grand and strong and noble. He was so earnest and tender and true. He was everything a minister ought to be.</p></div> </div>
