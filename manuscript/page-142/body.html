<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;But there must&mdash;sometime,&rdquo; mused Anne. &ldquo;Life seems like a cup of glory held to my lips just now. But there must be some bitterness in it&mdash;there is in every cup. I shall taste mine some day. Well, I hope I shall be strong and brave to meet it. And I hope it won&rsquo;t be through my own fault that it will come. Do you remember what Dr. Davis said last Sunday evening&mdash;that the sorrows God sent us brought comfort and strength with them, while the sorrows we brought on ourselves, through folly or wickedness, were by far the hardest to bear? But we mustn&rsquo;t talk of sorrow on an afternoon like this. It&rsquo;s meant for the sheer joy of living, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
