<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Only&mdash;!! Anne did not know that Ruby had written the first letter and that Gilbert had answered it from mere courtesy. She tossed Ruby&rsquo;s letter aside contemptuously. But it took all Diana&rsquo;s breezy, newsy, delightful epistle to banish the sting of Ruby&rsquo;s postscript. Diana&rsquo;s letter contained a little too much Fred, but was otherwise crowded and crossed with items of interest, and Anne almost felt herself back in Avonlea while reading it. Marilla&rsquo;s was a rather prim and colorless epistle, severely innocent of gossip or emotion. Yet somehow it conveyed to Anne a whiff of the wholesome, simple life at Green Gables, with its savor of ancient peace, and the steadfast abiding love that was there for her. Mrs. Lynde&rsquo;s letter was full of church news.</p></div> </div>
