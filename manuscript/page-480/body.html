The first day I came I remarked to Miss Maria that it looked a little like rain&mdash;and Miss Maria laughed. I said the road from the station was very pretty&mdash;and Miss Maria laughed. I said there seemed to be a few mosquitoes left yet&mdash;and Miss Maria laughed. I said that Prospect Point was as beautiful as ever&mdash;and Miss Maria laughed. If I were to say to Miss Maria, &lsquo;My father has hanged himself, my mother has taken poison, my brother is in the penitentiary, and I am in the last stages of consumption,&rsquo; Miss Maria would laugh. She can&rsquo;t help it&mdash;she was born so; but is very sad and awful.</p></div> </div>
