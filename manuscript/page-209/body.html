I won&rsquo;t hope, Anne. The disappointment would be too awful to bear. They&rsquo;re sure to want more for it than we can afford. Remember, it&rsquo;s on Spofford Avenue.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We must find out anyhow,&rdquo; said Anne resolutely. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late to call this evening, but we&rsquo;ll come tomorrow. Oh, Pris, if we can get this darling spot! I&rsquo;ve always felt that my fortunes were linked with Patty&rsquo;s Place, ever since I saw it first.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
