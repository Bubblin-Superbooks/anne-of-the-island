<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk nonsense, Phil. Do you know Mr. Gardner?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve met his two sisters, and I know of him. So does everybody worthwhile in Kingsport. The Gardners are among the richest, bluest, of Bluenoses. Roy is adorably handsome and clever. Two years ago his mother&rsquo;s health failed and he had to leave college and go abroad with her&mdash;his father is dead. He must have been greatly disappointed to have to give up his class, but they say he was perfectly sweet about it. Fee&mdash;fi&mdash;fo&mdash;fum, Anne. I smell romance. Almost do I envy you, but not quite. After all, Roy Gardner isn&rsquo;t Jonas.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
