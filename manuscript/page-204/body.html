<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to worry about it just now, anyway, and spoil this lovely afternoon,&rdquo; said Anne, gazing around her with delight. The fresh chill air was faintly charged with the aroma of pine balsam, and the sky above was crystal clear and blue&mdash;a great inverted cup of blessing. &ldquo;Spring is singing in my blood today, and the lure of April is abroad on the air. I&rsquo;m seeing visions and dreaming dreams, Pris. That&rsquo;s because the wind is from the west. I do love the west wind. It sings of hope and gladness, doesn&rsquo;t it? When the east wind blows I always think of sorrowful rain on the eaves and sad waves on a gray shore. When I get old I shall have rheumatism when the wind is east.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
