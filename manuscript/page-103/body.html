<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Then why not marry Alonzo?&rdquo; asked Priscilla gravely.</p><p>&ldquo;Think of marrying a name like Alonzo!&rdquo; said Phil dolefully. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe I could endure it. But he has a classic nose, and it WOULD be a comfort to have a nose in the family that could be depended on. I can&rsquo;t depend on mine. So far, it takes after the Gordon pattern, but I&rsquo;m so afraid it will develop Byrne tendencies as I grow older. I examine it every day anxiously to make sure it&rsquo;s still Gordon. Mother was a Byrne and has the Byrne nose in the Byrnest degree. Wait till you see it. I adore nice noses. Your nose is awfully nice, Anne Shirley. Alonzo&rsquo;s nose nearly turned the balance in his favor. But ALONZO! No, I couldn&rsquo;t decide. If I could have done as I did with the hats&mdash;stood them both up together, shut my eyes, and jabbed with a hatpin&mdash;it would have been quite easy.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
