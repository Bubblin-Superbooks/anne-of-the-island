<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Oh, I think some parts of it are fine,&rdquo; conceded Davy. &ldquo;That story about Joseph now&mdash;it&rsquo;s bully. But if I&rsquo;d been Joseph I wouldn&rsquo;t have forgive the brothers. No, siree, Anne. I&rsquo;d have cut all their heads off. Mrs. Lynde was awful mad when I said that and shut the Bible up and said she&rsquo;d never read me any more of it if I talked like that. So I don&rsquo;t talk now when she reads it Sunday afternoons; I just think things and say them to Milty Boulter next day in school. I told Milty the story about Elisha and the bears and it scared him so he&rsquo;s never made fun of Mr. Harrison&rsquo;s bald head once. Are there any bears on P.E. Island, Anne? I want to know.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
