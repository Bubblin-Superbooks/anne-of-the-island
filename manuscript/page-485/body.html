<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Jonas,&rsquo; I said&mdash;I forgot to call him Mr. Blake. Wasn&rsquo;t it dreadful? But there are times when things like that don&rsquo;t matter&mdash;&lsquo;Jonas, you were born to be a minister. You COULDN&rsquo;T be anything else.&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, I couldn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; he said soberly. &lsquo;I tried to be something else for a long time&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t want to be a minister. But I came to see at last that it was the work given me to do&mdash;and God helping me, I shall try to do it.&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;His voice was low and reverent. I thought that he would do his work and do it well and nobly; and happy the woman fitted by nature and training to help him do it. SHE would be no feather, blown about by every fickle wind of fancy.</p></div> </div>
