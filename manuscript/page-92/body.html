<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked Priscilla.</p><p>&ldquo;Because I simply couldn&rsquo;t make up my mind to do it. I never can make up my mind about anything myself&mdash;I&rsquo;m always afflicted with indecision. Just as soon as I decide to do something I feel in my bones that another course would be the correct one. It&rsquo;s a dreadful misfortune, but I was born that way, and there is no use in blaming me for it, as some people do. So I couldn&rsquo;t make up my mind to go and speak to you, much as I wanted to.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We thought you were too shy,&rdquo; said Anne.</p></div> </div>
