So let&rsquo;s go house-hunting at once, before exams come on.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it will be hard enough to get a really suitable house,&rdquo; warned Priscilla. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t expect too much, Anne. Nice houses in nice localities will probably be away beyond our means. We&rsquo;ll likely have to content ourselves with a shabby little place on some street whereon live people whom to know is to be unknown, and make life inside compensate for the outside.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
