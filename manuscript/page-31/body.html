<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t exactly WANT to, Davy, but I feel I ought to go.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t want to go you needn&rsquo;t. You&rsquo;re grown up. When I&rsquo;m grown up I&rsquo;m not going to do one single thing I don&rsquo;t want to do, Anne.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All your life, Davy, you&rsquo;ll find yourself doing things you don&rsquo;t want to do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Davy flatly. &ldquo;Catch me! I have to do things I don&rsquo;t want to now &lsquo;cause you and Marilla&rsquo;ll send me to bed if I don&rsquo;t. But when I grow up you can&rsquo;t do that, and there&rsquo;ll be nobody to tell me not to do things. Won&rsquo;t I have the time! Say, Anne, Milty Boulter says his mother says you&rsquo;re going to college to see if you can catch a man. Are you, Anne? I want to know.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
